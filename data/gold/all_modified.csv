He started when we came in from outside (temp has cooled here in NJ) playing with leaves. He had a few marks on his face that seemed to itch and I thought were random bites. He had PB J for lunch but I don't remember if he had a bite after or before I noticed the hives. I didn't think much of it. He napped and then at dinnertime (no nuts then), a rash spread across his face and then all over his torso. I gave him Benadryl and they went away. The next day we were in and out but not playing outside. When he ate lunch (PB J), I noticed it again but they were on his face this time. More Benadryl. I took him to the Dr. who gave me an epipen and a referral to an allergist just in case it's related to peanuts all of the sudden. Long story short...he's had them on/off and the last time he had PB was Tues. afternoon (1/2 sandwich). They seem to go away and then come back in a different spot. The Dr. said it could be anything and related to his cold/cough last week and still had fluid in his ears. My question is - I thought I read somewhere that food allergies are usually more acute, even though hives aren't considered chronic until after 6 wks. He seems to feel fine but still a little congested. The only other allergy he has (unconfirmed) is mango because he got red splotchiness by his mouth the only 2x he had it as a toddler. I've read there's a cross reactivity between mango and birch pollen (we had 3 birch trees planted in the yard last year). I'm staying away from nuts until our appt on the 19th but dread the dx of a peanut allergy, given how serious it is. Still, does this seem likely? I would think the PB is totally out of his system by now. I mean, last night before bed, he broke out again. Also, when I go to the allergist, if it is a nut allergy, can they tell me the likelihood of how serious an allergy it is? I'm petrified it'll be deadly. I can't believe it. He always ate it without a problem. Just hoping it'a a coincidence. Thanks for your help...",10,0.215255839

I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia early in the year and so my weakness and shortness of breath were placed in the category with that illness. Well recently (last month) I've developed terrible lightheaded spells and dizziness, along with a couple fainting spells, weakness, and trouble catching my breath with less exertion than normal. I also get strange sensations in my chest I don't even know how to explain. No rapid heartbeat, although occasionally I get some really forceful beats. I'm having a hard time getting around in general and it seemed to have come on rather suddenly. Well my first EKG came back normal, so doc had me do a Halt monitor for 24 hours...that came back normal as well. So we dropped the subject for a while and were just going to wait it out. Well I collapsed at work and was unable to get back up. Things are getting worse. The doctor ordered a Carotid artery ultrasound, which came back normal and an echocardiogram. The Echocardiogram showed mild mitral valve prolapse. So I was wondering, even with mild mitral valve prolapse there can be symptoms right? A lot of my symptoms seem to line up perfectly, I have the strange coughs everyday that seem to have no origin, a hard time breathing when laying down and especially after activity (note I usually am pretty active during the day), chest pain, and of course fatigue...which I think is basically worse fatigue on top of the fibro. This does make sense right? I am hoping my doctor can provide some treatment for me starting this week, but is there much they can do for a mild prolapse even though the symptoms are severe? Or could there be something else exacerbating this even more? Any advice is greatly appreciated! -Liz",65,0.298108368

I never questioned years of occasional light headedness and dizzy spells when standing too quickly (usually after tying laces etc), I just put it down to getting older (I'm still only 43), anyhoo, about five years ago I noticed that when I was relaxed in the evenings, especially when lying on my back, that I skipped beats :dizzy:, aaagh . So I immediately made an appointment and went to the docs, who said it was nothing to worry about, happens all the time to young fit people (I excercise regularly, cycling upto 100 miles a week), so I relaxed, cut out ALL cafeine including chocolate and things returned to normal. However, there's more, early last year, symptoms returned with a vegeance, to the extent that I could gaurantee dropping beats if I laid on my back. It has now got to the point where I know when the dropped beat is going to happen, and I feel, what I can only describe as a lump in my throat followed by the thump in my ear. So back to the docs, who this time hooked me upto a 24Hour ECG, sure enough, when relaxed, dropped beats. I was diagnosed with the above mouthfull in April, again, the consultant said not to worry, it's common in young fit people, the only treatment is a pace maker :confused:, but he'd only recommend one if I started having Syncopic episodes (blacking out), or if I still have them to age 45. I haven't had a blackout yet, but my resting heart rate is between 55-60, I'd better not get any fitter ;), but I'm not too far off 45. My problem now is, that I am now feeling the skipped beats all the time, probably 1 every 10 mins, even now typing this i've noticed 2 or 3, so should I just carry on and ignore them, am I putting myself at risk, I'd rather not have a pace maker, but I don't want to exasperate the problem.

We have known each other for 5 years and lived together for 2 We have always got on very well and she informed me that she suffered from depression when we moved in together. She takes medication, and showed some mild symtoms of depression from time to time but I was aware of her situation always helped her through and eveything was fine untill about 5 months ago (same time as she started a new relationship) when she started to get quite bad. Something very small can trigger a huge reaction in her! I have witnessed her tearing her hair out slamming doors and screaming horrible things at me. I will give an example she has become extremely forgetfull and last week forgot to lock the front door when I discovered this I called her and said you forgot to lock the front door again. She went crazy screaming and shouting she went home from work in a state, said she was moving out because I am controlling her life - its like she really beleives that. She went home and stayed with her parents and then came home to tell me she had made the decision to move out. She then arrived home the following day as if nothing had happened and was very hyper all weekend. She says very nasty things to me during these episodes and I can usually put it aside and help her through but it is getting harder - this time I have not been able too, her doctor recently upped her meds bur this is making her vomit allot so I really don't think she is getting it. She thinks that this is all my fault and that I am using her condition against her whenever I suggest she get help. Her boyfriend is now also experiencing these mood swings but not as bad as I am. I am very worried about her as she was such a nice person and I now feel like I am living with a pubescent teenager. Whenever she has one of these episodes she goes to her parents but I do not think she is giving them the right impression of what is really happening. She spends most Saturdays and Sundays in bed (she has a full time job monday to Friday) She also smokes allot of weed and takes ecstacy every Saturday night. I have explained that someone with her condition should not take drugs but she doesn't listen and her drug use is gettting worse. I really don't know what to do I am not quailified to deal with this and am thinking of going to her parents as I suspect she isn't telling them what is really happening.

Perhaps, but not likely. If you're feeling up to it, feel free to read a bit on me. If not, that's fine as well. Scroll down for the start of depression, maybe you can assist me. The paragraphs below that are in italics aren't all that important. I think. I'm not exactly sure how this all started. My life was pretty normal. My parents were loving, my little brother adored me and things were picture perfect. Of course, my dad would sometimes threaten to hit me with a belt at times, but stuff like that was normal. But somehow, it wasn't, and it stuck to me for a while to be afraid of him. Now, I suppose I was around eight when I began to show symptoms of OCD. If something didn't feel right the first time, (ex. walking on square tiles, touching objects), I would have to repeat this over and over until it felt right. Well, this I could handle. It didn't exactly disrupt my daily life. But then things became worse. My brother began vomiting every time he ate something. I was horrified. I blamed it on germs. Thus, the day to day wars began. I started to refuse food, due to germs being on them . This went on for a few months before my dad, finally fed up with me, slammed down half a granola bar on the table before. Eat, he roared. Just eat this much. I couldn't. I sat there for a very long time. My dad admitted defeat when I started bawling. I was sent to the hospital for a few days, hooked up to a IV. And that was the end of the OCD phase of my life. Next came DEPRESSION. Yes, I became suicidal. Yes, for some reason I talked about my plans with my therapist and he consulted with my mother. I was sent to a Mental Institute. I gave them all the information they asked for and I was sent out after a mere nine days. They told me to go to a school so I would be able to socialize with people in my age group. Please note that I was homeschooled my whole life and being sent to school at age thirteen was quite a change. **Important** My first few weeks was pretty challenging. I was used to conversing with adults, not people in a middle school. Things soon changed for the better, and I was actually quite the star. I befriended everyone in the middle school (Though, quite small) and I actually felt happy for a while. I even made a best friend. I'll keep her name private and nickname her Clarissa. Clarissa was everything I wasn't. She was girly, loud, outgoing and somewhat pretty. I loved Clarissa, we went everywhere together. We talked about everything. I trusted her with my life. You probably know where this is going, right? Betrayal. I was in shock. From there on, I cut myself away from the world. No, I was so afraid of the world, I thought if I just ignored it, it would get better. After a couple years of social isolation, it did get better, and I made yet another friend. During the summer, we did everything together. I was happy to the point of bursting. Then school came along. The pressure of being an honor student was beginning to get to me. The feelings of being alone in my classes was at its highest. My teachers would have to force people to group with me, and in the groups I was in, I was always ignored. I began to wonder what I was doing wrong. Did I not seem friendly? Did I look that much appalling? Maybe I had to take the first step. Oh, how I tried. Attempt after attempt. Failure after failure. I lost hope. I gained yet another bump in the road: Social Phobia. My depression ate off of this ailment and it enjoyed every taste of it. This brings us to the PRESENT. I cry whenever I see others happy, when I see others in love, when I see people in groups. Sometimes the tears well up all on their own for no apparent reason. (It's probably just the constant loneliness). My best friend, lets call her Ali, always talks about her significant other. One day I just snapped and walked off, crying silent tears. For a while now, I feel no happiness, no feelings of love. None of the good feelings. I don't know whats wrong with me, maybe you can assist me and figure out whats up with me. I suppose I am just an idiotic young girl, but it feels nice to let off some steam. Thank you for your time.",44,0.773491817

I left school when i was 15 due to being bullied - which has left me practically as a recluse. I have no friends, boyfriend and no job. I am attempting to return to college this year (i've tried twice before to go but froze and refused to leave the car) I've been trying to repair myself but am totally unable to go anywhere without my mum - i panic when i'm on my own. :( I'm on prozac which helps somewhat but not as much as i would like it to. During school i got called a lot of terrible names (aswell as being pushed around and punched daily) about my appearance which mentally scarred me to this day. If you had told me when i 12yrs old that i would be this way - i would of thought 'absolutely no way'. I used to be extremeley bubbly, confident and most of all - never cared what people thought about me! I wear a lot of makeup (and i mean full makeup) on the rare occasions i do go out, i am obsessed with my appearance. I always want to look perfect (if that even exists!) - and feel that i'm not remotely attractive without it, even though people compliment me and have had a lot of men show interest in me - but i put that down to my make-up and absolutely PANIC at the thought of never having it, as i feel nobody would even touch me without it. And that has ruined any potential chance of having boyfriends. I constantly feel i am not good enough, and a lot of the guys ive been with compare me to other girls. I also feel that they would leave me if a more attractive female came long, which ultimately drives them away - its ruining my life and most of all, messing with me mentally. People often make nasty comments now about how much cosmetics i wear, which i can't help :( - but this whole situation is messing with my head. It's ruling my life, i have this unattainable image in my head that i want to look like. I feel that because i don't look like the models/actresses thatr men obsess over, that i'm ugly and disgusting. I get so upset by it that i hurt myself, because i hate myself so much - so much that i just want to die. I'm sorry for going on like i have! But i'm at a loss of what and where to go. I always had ambitions of going to college, then uni.... or even just being like a normal 20yr old. :( My obsession with my appearance is killing me mentally and disabling me in making the steps to go forward in my life. My parents are sick to death of me and think i'm lazy. The truth is i have become so unmotivated i feel like there is no point. I just feel like crying all the time because i hate how my life has turned out and i want to change it now, i dont want to be 30 years old and in the same boat. I also want to be less obsessed with my appearance. My family view me as a nobody, and when i do speak to other girls, i have nothing to talk about as i'm doing nothing with my life - no wonder i have no friends.:( I really need some help, i want to be how i used to be before i became this way.

I recently had a scary experience and was hoping someone here could offer some advice. I apologize in advance for the length of the post; I've had a lot on my mind. About 3 weeks ago I experienced what can only be described as a heart flip flop/flutter. I have experienced the flutter sensation before and just shrugged it off. This one was different, it didn't end right away and when I felt my pulse on my neck, it had no stable rhythm and was erratic. Oddly, it felt like it didn't match the beat in my chest. Naturally, panic set in and it became difficult to feel anything but a racing heart beat due to fear and anxiety. I was terrified I had a heart attack or cardiac arrest. I was driven to the doctor, he took my pulse and looked at my physical exam results from a few months back (which included an EKG and full blood/urine/stool workup) and concluded that my pulse was currently steady and there was nothing wrong with me. He noted that I have a sinus arrhythmia but that condition is benign. Given my history with panic attacks, he surmised that I had a nasty PVC or PAC attack, perhaps two or three in a row. He told me to cut back on caffeine (I only have 1 cup of coffee per day) and quit smoking (which I know I need to do, haven't had one since). He wasn't at all concerned due to my age (28 year old female) and overall health. He sent me home more worried that I would obsess and cause myself more undue stress and panic. He's right, that�s all I've been doing since that day. Lately, I haven't had any flutters, but tons of palpitations that radiate in my upper chest and throat. The worst is at night when I try to sleep, I feel my heart beat in a relatively steady rhythm, but I feel an almost reverberation through my body that is faster than my actual pulse. When I read online about AFib, it said that the heart quivers at a rapid, rapid rate but the pulse is relatively normal. So I didn't know if that sounds like AFib, or Atrial Flutter. Its making me crazy, I can't fall asleep at night because I feel my body shaking. My pulse isn't horribly fast when this happens, it�s probably not above 80 to 90 but the sensations in my body feel faster. Do these symptoms suggest a possible heart problem or can it all be benign from anxiety? Can a really strong PVC cause damage and lead to AFib? I'm sorry for the extremely long post. I am very scared and don't know what to do. I made another appointment with my doctor, but he seems to not be taking this very seriously. Thank you.",65,0.300513737

I've also been fairly active my whole life, and for the past twelve years I've been running at least 3 miles every other day, sometimes 4 miles, 9-12 miles a week, nothing outrageous. It's harder to maintain your fitness as you get older, whereas occasional exercise like sports, hiking, biking, swimming etc used to work in the past, I took up regular running when exercising on occasion wasn't enough any more. Running doesn't get any easier as you age either - foot pain is becoming more of an issue these days. I don't really like running but I've found nothing better that conveys its health benefits, and with age I'm no longer trying to improve my times every day. Blood pressure and weight are both normal, I could stand to lose five to eight pounds or so, but my physicians deem me in good health every six months. I do not smoke and am on no medication, but I take a multivitamin every day. I don't drink alcohol, except for a single 12 oz beer or one glass of wine on occasion, never more than one, perhaps once or twice a month. I drink no more than two cups of tea a day, usually just one. NO coffee, a little sugar, a little red meat, no junk food, absolutely no soft drinks. Pizza once in a while. I don't pay excessive attention to my diet, I'm as far from a vegetarian as you can get but I think I eat OK. In other words, I think my health is excessively average. The only factor I haven't mentioned is STRESS. I think it's fair to say I've been pretty stressed recently, job and money-related STRESS thanks to this awful economy, you all know what I mean. Stress is part of life, you can't avoid it, but I've tried to mitigate its effects by running regularly and trying to remain optimistic about our economic future. The palpitations started suddenly last December. I found myself in a life-threatening work situation, in which I felt my heart was in my throat for a period of several hours (sorry I can't get into details). I knew it had been stressful, and kept talking about it with my coworkers for a few days, sort of a PTSD kind of reaction, though PTSD sufferers have much more severe reactions and I don't want to minimize that. I don't believe I had PTSD, I know those who have and I don't have it. That's when the palpitations started. They'd occur at night without fail, when I'm trying to fall asleep and thinking about all the stressful things in my life. It's hard to fall asleep when it feels like someone is punching your chest at irregular intervals. This made the problem worse, I was already worried about the palpitations and now I had insomnia to deal with. I could not fall asleep until I was really exhausted, and due to my general fitness, getting exhausted is difficult. I shoveled snow all day once and still I couldn't get tired. I began to suspect a thyroid disorder or some other imbalance, but in any event I completely stopped all caffeine and nutritional supplements. Nothing helped. The only thing that made me feel a little better was running, so I stepped that up a notch, running a bit further every other day - not easy when your feet already hurt. I added regular biking on non-running days, when the weather got better. At no time did I feel lightheaded, short of breath, pain, or anything else. Just the irregular heartbeat. Otherwise I felt great. I kept up my exercise regimen and actually increased it, since physically I felt better than I've ever been. Really! But the palpitations at night were horrible. The palpitations would sometimes occur during the day, especially when facing a stressful situation. The problem is my tolerance for a stressful situation became absurdly low. Asking me for anything beyond the time of day would bring on the palpitations. My tolerance for STRESS became zero. On one particularly bad night, I swore I was having a heart attack because my damn heart was beating completely irregularly and driving me up a wall. Sleep became impossible. It started affecting my job. I was being driven insane from days of sleep deprivation. I woke up my wife and asked her to drive me to the hospital. On the way there, she asked about my other symptoms and as I've explained, I had absolutely none - no crushing pain or anything else associated with a heart attack, just panicky since I was alternately afraid my heart would stop completely, and partly hoping it would since it was driving me nuts. My wife patiently talked me down, God bless her, I gradually felt better, so we turned around and went home. After researching my symptoms and reaching the same conclusions as everyone else, I got an off-schedule appointment with my physician who not surprisingly declared me in excellent health again. Nothing wrong with the blood, nothing wrong with the heart, normal EKG etc. Totally boring exam. He recommended keeping up the exercise, eat less fat, less than I already eat, etc. More of the same everyone already hears. The only recommendation was to start an active stress-reduction regimen. Ironic, but it seems stress reduction requires active intervention and techniques - there are many. He recommended a book. He said there are some medications that could be prescribed, but he wasn't in favor of any of them. I really wasn't feeling particularly stressed, no more than I have been, like I said I felt in the best physical health of my life, but I got the book and started reading anyway. Certainly running is a good stress-reduction technique, but it wasn't enough. I took a week off of work, took the family on vacation, thought that would help get my mind off of things but it only make matters worse. Bottom line: Vacations are stressful. I was miserable. Last week I had the worst palpitations ever. I was up all night, no sleep and at the end of my rope. Then, as quickly as the palpitations started, they stopped. The night following my all-nighter I had NO palpitations. None. Once or twice in the past several months, I may have experienced only a few fleeting palpitations, but never none at all. The next night, no palpitations again. None. It was blissful. I lived with palpitations every day for months, but it's been a week now, no palpitations. I think they're gone for good, but if they ever come back, I'll know they're not permanent. What did I do? I don't really feel much has changed, the economy is still awful thanks to the idiots in charge of it, but I did put the stress-reduction techniques into practice. Since I gave up caffeine and alcohol as potential factors, I had gradually brought them back, one cup of tea, a glass of beer with dinner. They weren't helping, but they didn't make things worse and may actually help. The beer helps me feel relaxed and I just like my tea in the morning. Summary? My palpitations came on suddenly and made me miserable. Without sleep, life became intolerable. They left just as suddenly. Clearly, STRESS was a causal factor. My observations lead me to conclude its effects creep up on you gradually. Its physical manifestation isn't gradual... like a machine your body absorbs stress without complaint right up to the point that something breaks, and it tends to break in a dramatic fashion. The body is a mysterious thing, and heart palpitations appear to be a phenomenon that's poorly understood and has many potential causes. There is no lab test for stress. You can't eliminate stress. If you're alive, you'll have it. Stress REQUIRES active intervention and management. Just add it to your growing list of responsibilities. I hope this helps others who may have experienced these symptoms. I was miserable, but my palpitations disappeared IMMEDIATELY, the day immediately after they were at their worst. Yours could too. Keep up the stress reduction techniques, even when you think they're not working. I'd be interested to hear any professional opinions regarding my experience.",65,0.518164568

She said they were told to give 20 mg of Prozac in place of the Pristique. She said I will just stop the Pristique and go right to the Prozac and it should minimize the bad effects.

For some reason, these thoughts have been concentrated on my heart. Four years ago when the anxiety first started I got all kinds of tests done to make sure it wasn't physically-based. (Up to this point I got EKGs done every year once a year as part of a work-based wellness checkup.) For some reason, the way this nurse did the EKG showed something strange (they could never tell me what). They sent me to a cardiologist who could tell at that time I was freaked out about my heart. He suggested I have a nuclear stress test done to put my mind at ease once and for all. I sat through the 6-hour test, all the nuclear stuff and treadmill stuff, etc., and the prognosis from the cardiologist was that I had a strong heart. Since then, I seem to alternate from being okay for a while to having periods of being terrified of it and convinced I'm having symptoms. I've had EKGs since then that have showed up just fine. I even recently went to the ER when I had slight chest pain that I kind of knew was muscular but that had me anxious; they did another EKG, tested my blood, did chest X-rays and all showed just fine and I was sent home. Recently my left arm was sore for a while; it was kind of obviously muscular (it only hurt when I raised and held it a certain way and hurt worse when I flexed) but it had me freaked out. Then it began to go away as these things do. Today my lower tooth or teeth has been sore; nothing else, just that. It's worse when I drink cold liquid. (I have something of a habit of gritting my teeth sometimes, which is what I assume it could be.) I end up posting on boards that have you pay to get answers from doctors; recently I did that for my arm. Now I'm anxious about my tooth/teeth. My questions would be these: Could my tooth/teeth thing be heart related? It isn't too severe, but what would it feel like? Would it be by itself? Should the tests I've had done so far - nuclear stress test, multiple EKGs, chest x-rays - be enough to convince me that I shouldn't have this severe anxiety?

Alternating pulses, sometimes it will be racing very quickly, and then sometimes it slows down to the point that I check my pulse to make sure it's beating at all. Also, sometimes when it's racing, if I take a breath it feels like it skips a beat. 2. Sometimes when I try to fall asleep I will have this very sharp pain down the entire center of my chest that radiates over also to the left side, it worsens as I take breaths. 3. I often feel weird pulsations around my chest that are felt in my stomach and upper back as well. Sometimes they feel like they travel all the way down to my feet. 4. The lymph nodes on my chest are significant swollen, and I keep getting little poppable bumps on my chest lately, but I've never been prone to acne and never got things like this on my chest before. (However, i think it perhaps could be a heat rash from using a heating pad at night to dull the chest pain) 5.

Also, my hands sometimes look an awkward pale/reddish color. 6. I'm not sure if it's related, but also lately I've been getting a blue-purple tint in my legs and feet, and the soles of my feet ache when i walk 7. I also experience sharp or unpleasant pains under my left ribs, occasionally on the right side too, but it's not common. 8.

I also feel this in my chest sometimes, the sensation of air or something shifting. 9. The most perturbing symptom however that I experience from time to time is the physical pop or jolt of my chest.

Heart problems run in his family. When I was recently at the doctors I was told that I have a fast heart rate and heart murmurs. My doctor isn't worried about the murmurs but made no comment about my heart rate. I find that I tire easily, mildly to moderately. I've had a few dullish kind of pain in the middle of my chest (sternum?) It isn't very bad and sometimes its almost to the point where I could ignore it. I find that its when I exercise for lenghtly times (such as when I am at gymnastics) or sometimes when I breath in deeply or tense my stomach-chest muscles. Sometimes my sternum is a bit blue when it hurts. I am having another visit with the doctor next week and I'm going to bring this up (if I remember.) What could be causing this? Could it possibly be the very early signs of a heart problem?",65,0.596182189

I don't know what to do, I can never be happy. I've been suffering from cronic depression and bi-polar for the past few years. Some events that have happened in my life have only made things worse. I've been allergic to most of the anti-depressants that my doctor/psychartist have put me on. The main thing that depresses me is my body. I'm 119 Ibs (54.1 kgs ), 5'3 - 4 . I've done lots of cardio exercises and dieting to lose weight. But the only area it seems to target is my breasts. I've gone down to a B cup, and I don't want them to get any smaller, but I want to lose weight. I've tried everything. The only other alternative I can think of is plastic surgery. Liposuction and Breast Implants, but I don't have the money to get them, and my boyfriend doesn't want me to get those done. I'm also a recovering anorexic and cutter. I use to go days without eating, and I still would barely lose any weight. I was physically abused in a past relationship, and my father and brother emotionally and mentally abuse me. I've been picked on, and tormented for the majority of my life. I can't even go outside without someone calling me fat or ugly, so I sometimes play 'Hermit'. Which has caused me to lose most of my friends. All through junior high and high school I was picked on for the 'peach fuzz' I had over my upper lip, and on my arms. I was called fat, and manly on a daily basis. My boyfriend used to be addicted to pornagraphy. So I feel as though I've failed him as well. I cannot compare to any of those women without plastic surgery. He gave it up for me, but I still cannot get over the hurt. He quit looking at it around the end of august. I've forgiven him, but I cannot forget. This is the other part of the reason I have such issues with my body. He tells me I'm beautiful, but I don't feel like I am, I want to look like a model. I want to look the way he wants me to. I was recently offered a job as a model, but then they told me I was too overweight. So you can imagine how that made me feel. And of course, everyone I know has had to rub this fact in my face. My closest friends have told me I'm a little fat . And told me if I didn't like myself, I should change. I've tried to change, but I can't. I don't know about other women, but I sure wouldn't feel female if I didn't have breasts. Also contributing to the depression, my best friend died when I was younger. And lots of close family members and family friends have died the past year. There has been many accidents, and my uncle took his own life. I've gotten to the point in which I want to give up. I can't even watch my favorite tv programs anymore without bursting into tears because I can't look like them. I know what some of you are going to say, you're going to tell me to go get help. I have gotten help, I've been to counselluers, and psychartists, and doctors. I'm beyond repair, I don't know what to do. They don't know what to do. My family and boyfriend seem to have given up on trying to help me. I barely have the will to get out of bed in the mornings, I just want to waste away, since there's nothing I can do to make anything better. I'm sick of crying, but I can't stop. I thought everything was getting better, but it only seems to get worse.

I've had kidney stone issues for 12 years but I've handled the ups/downs with this illness. Off on for the past 2 years I've had some back issues but these got really bad in February. I have could barely stand up straight and was in constant pain. I was on muscle relaxers (hate them) and percocet (also hate) for a few weeks until the physical therapy the Dr. prescribed was starting to make me feel better. Then at end of March, I had a complication. The new exercise at PT earlier in the day later that night caused my back to lock up and shooting pain down my leg (new symptom). Then I started (and still do) have numbness up/down my leg and in foot. I had two surgeries where they did the 3 injections (steroids novacaine) which did help with the pain but still have numbness. So the said i should see a nerosurgeon. I chose the one a family member had for their back surgery and had to wait 6 weeks but didn't mind since i was stable and knew the surgeon was good. So he gave some options before surgery so I am trying lumbar traction. Seems a little better but all numbness nerve pain still there. Oh yeah before when to surgeon, prior Dr put me on Nerontin for nerve pain. Not sure if its working but I've gained 20 pounds in the past 3-4 months. I see surgeon in 2 weeks and if the traction doesn't work, I'll be having surgery which is making me depressed. I would missed 6-8 weeks of work. I would say my spouse is helping during all this but not what I need. I get tired of asking to do things i would normally do. (sweep floor, take out trash, pick up after him self). Then he'll say I would have done that (we'll then do it and don't leave it sitting around) or Tell me what you want me to do which I've already asked the same things over and over. My husband was hospitalized almost 2.5 years ago due to bowel issues. This lead to surgery for him but then he got infection while in hosptital which led to a temporary ilestomy where the cut a opening in stomach for waste while the prior surgery site recovers. This lead to large hernia that had to get fixed once when they reversed the ileostomy and 2nd about 2 months later when first fix that was done w/o mesh since ileostomy was being reversed could not do and 2nd with mesh. The Dr warned that the was 25% change of getting another hernia and he had to lose weight. You would think that would make him lose weight right? No. Hernias came back but were small. Went back to surger (8 months ago) and Dr yelled at him on his weight and said didn't want to do surgery if they could avoid it. So I've tried to encourage eating better, going for walks etc. Now last night during his sleep he got another new hernia worse than before. He just started back and college and works part time (lost last FT job due to all those surgeries) I was so mad today at him and said how are you suppose to help take care of me when he can't even take care of himself? I just have felt like crying all day. The past week I even thought about my surgery for my back. I would never consider hurting myself but I thought how much easier it would be just to not wake up from the anestisa. :( Thanks for letting me vent my emotions since i can't do them with my family",44,0.264208083

I don't know if other woman get these 3 tests done yearly? I ask this because I mentioned to my gyno that my right breast felt very dense and weird feeling. so she sent me to have an ultra sound of it. the dr wound up calling me 3 days later saying that they found lymph nodes. one in the breast further from the nipple and on the outter part of the breast, in a chain closer to the rib, 3 more, along the very edge of the breast. she referred me to a breast surgeon to get her opinion on it since i m high risk because of both sisters and an aunt who had breast cancer and a father with colon cancer, brother with hodgkins lymphoma and I m on estrogen patches due to total hysterectomy back in 2005. total hysterectomy at age 48. Dr. told me she felt it was ok, and just breast tissue, but it's not in the left breast at all, told me that if I wanted to, to bring back the copy of my next mammo due this coming October and sent me on my merry way. the next thing I know, I got home, the phone rang and hour later and it was the breast doctor. she said that since I had so much history on the fill out sheet of patient history that she didn't do it all when I was there and that she entered it all in and also was going by her expertise, and told me that 20% is considered high risk and I fell in the category of 30% risk of breast cancer and that she wants me to get an MRI with contrast of the breasts and that she wants to see me again when I'm done having it. she told me I can wait but get it done within the next month. she put a little fear into me compared to the way I felt when I first left her office. I know that having breast cancer in lymph nodes is a very very low chance. something like 2%. IF cancer is in the lymph nodes, it's usually a form of lymphoma. I have a history of possibility of lymphoma in my neck, same side of the breast with the enlarged lymphnodes that was excised back in 98 which turned out to be atypical follicular lymphoid hyperplasia' , I was sent to a disease specialtist who performed and HIV test and I never went back to him after finding out it was negative. I wasnt' told if I needed to go back every so many years for follow ups. It wasn't cancer, but it was something. so I'm asking anyone here if they know if it's common treatment to have all 3 tests performed yearly if at high risk? or is my dr. thinking that maybe something really is going on because of my risk and the nodes being enlarged.

All went fine, back to normal excercise in about 2 wks..Previously prescribed Lisinopril 20 mg for HBP about a year earlier. Also on the TLC Diet! 5 wks. later I got blood done and it was excellent. High trigllycerides and low HDL's are genetic for the family. Chol.-127 from 230 Trig-139 from 300 HDL-24 could never get this higher and still can't! LDL- 75 from about 165 :cool: 7 weeks into statin therapy I had some of the most commom side effects to the drug or drugs. Mood swings, dizzIness, back pain and pain in feet, soreness in leg muscles/ribs, sweating/hot flashes, blurry vision that could last for 3-4 days and so on. Can't live like this. Total BS! Changed some meds. around like bp med.. so I could isolate my problem. I felt I was having panic attacks 2 hrs. after taking my Plavix, Simvastatin and Lisinopril, oh...and QVAR inhaler,still freaking out! Stopped inhaler..same problem existed. Also taking Centrum Silver Multi -Vitamin once daily. My doc told me it was the statin drug and reduce dose to 1/2 ,10mg. Now I have less protection than before against build-up. I still had problems with the statin and it put me on my ass for about 7 months. No excercise or anything for seven months. I just could'nt work through the medicines side effects. He said take it or die! I had enough of this b.s. and went off it completely but slowly my BW figures began to climb ''chol 127 to 153. Didn't want to see it rise any further. So back on a 1/2 dose of statin. I never quit the Plavix and Asprin and am still on it . It's now November and I got fed up with their b.s. and went to RYR. Been on it for 4 wks. and my numbers improved very well. Chol -175 could be lower Trig - 138 HDL -22 LDL -125 needs to be lowered :confused: I still have some sweating, mild leg soreness, .

I've been on the TLC DIET ever since my stent placement:mad:, still can't bring the weight down. I was reading another post here where someone mentioned the RYR had to be the right type, as to steer away from any side effects, and that person mentioned Hypocol? I will check into this. Is the brand I'm currently on any good? Also, another person mentioned checking to see if the ''manfacturer is USP certified, and does the manufacturing assurance control supersede USP and NF [National Formulary specifications'' ? What does all this mean? This is why I question if I'm taking the correct RYR product. I did call the company and they did say they're USP certified. Not labeled on the bottle though.

I can't tell if what is going on with me has to do with the car accident I had a few years ago, where I hit my head and so certain physiological aspects have changed, or if this is a true allergy that seems to be getting worse over time. Or could it be hormonal? I'm a 43 year old female.... I enjoy having a glass of wine or beer or single malt sctoch. I am not much of a mixed drink drinker as I really don't like sweet drinks. What I have noticed over the last couple of years is after just one drink now I don't have that warm cozy feeling, alcohol acts like caffeine in my system. When I go to lay down to sleep my heart races like crazy, and I have what seem similar to hot flashes and profuse sweating. And I feel completely wired. Last night we went out with friends for dinner and then headed to a club for dancing and music. I had had scotch before dinner, wine with dinner, and then a beer at the club. I had lots of water in between. I had no feelings of beind drunk whatsoever. When we got home and I went to bed I had what seemed almost similar to panic attack symptoms....my heart was racing like crazy, I was sweating, I couldn't settle down at all. Prior to my car accident a few years ago, I had your normal reaction to alcohol....feeling comfortable and it never affected my sleep whatsoever. So, if anyone could help me determine...is it because I hit my head in the accident and so now alcohol affects my brain differently? is it hormonal related? or is it an allergy??",10,0.349464483

That worked well for a year, but now I am feeling worse then ever. My doctor switched my medication, but I am still feeling horrible. My deal is, I don't understand why I am depressed. I have absolutely no reason to be. Granted, I don't really have a lot of friends, but I still got a fair amount. I have had epiphanies about what it is, but they always turn out to be false. For example, I thought it was because I was in majoring in architecture, so I switched to civil engineering. I felt really glad and happy for the whole part of a day, but then went back to how I was. This happens everytime. Now I realize I'm not even hoping for anything anymore. I'm not striving anymore, and this is affecting my work and my relations. I have read a couple posts of how people in their 30's or 40's are feeling bad that were kind of as depressed as I at my age. I really don't want to be fighting this when I am that old.

In addition to being pregnant, I also took progesterone supplements to help carry to term. I recently discovered the lump in my right breast at about the 9 o'clock area towards the outer edge. I went to my ob/gyn a few days later and after feeling it both lying down and sitting up, he concluded that he thought it was a cyst. It is rather hard, smooth, and can be moved around. It kind of feels like a grape. I am a D cup and my breasts are very dense. His first comment was that he thought I had fibrocystic breasts. Anyway, he sent me for an ultrasound. When I went, the tech couldn't find the lump. SHe had me show her a few times and had me show her so she could feel with her own fingers. She never found anything on the screen. The thing that makes me confused is that she told me that ultrasounds can only show if there is a cyst or not and that she did not find a cyst. She went to speak to the radiologist and said he may recommend a mammogram even though I'm younger than 40. She then came back and said Nope you can go ahead home. Your doctor will get the results. She told me it is up to him what to do next and that he may just want to watch it for awhile. I don't understand because everything I've read says that ultrasounds are a better tool for younger women with dense breasts to further evaluate any mass AND can tell if the lump is cystic or solid. I don't see my doctor until tomorrow morning and I'm scared! I don't know if the fact that I didn't need a mammogram or that she said he may just want to watch it is a good sign. Also, I swear I can feel other areas of my breasts that feel similar. I can feel a similar spot up near my armpits in both breasts in the same area. I just don't know what to think at this point. I have no family history of cancer of any type. My mother-in-law has reassured me that it is probably a fibroadenoma because she had the same exact situation happen to her when she was in her 20's.

I was fine for 10 years. Now the pain is coming back, but I don't feel the palpitations very much. My last EKG (several years ago) was normal.

439158218,How should I manage or treat symptoms or conditions X?,No,,833707,Very Worried," Dear All I am a newbie here. As the header says I had a quaruple heart bypass nine years ago, when I was 49. To some degree I can only blame myself given my lifestyle at the time, but you know the old saying it will never happen to me . Well it did. I can honestly say that my bypass was a total success, it was carried out by Mr Mediratta at The Liverpool Heart and Chest Clinic. A real Gent with a fantastic bedside manner. On or around August 2010 I was not feeling very well, I consulted with my cardiologist who booked me in for a chemical stress test. When the results came back I was told that all my bypass grafts were in prestige condition. I was very reluctant to believe this as I was not feeling at all well and was having both chest and throat pains. Nothing to the same magnitude some nine years earlier, but still uncomfortable. I complained further and had to attend the hospital to have and angiogram with contrast, I had to stay in the day ward. My cardiologist visited me later that day after my angiogram. I could tell by his face that I was going to be given bad news. He told me that three of my bypass grafts were in perfect condition but one to the right hand side of my heart I beleive it's a vein graft from my leg was completely blocked and they were not in a position to do anything about it. My heart surgeon told me he did not want to open my chest again as he could damage the three good grafts but there was nowhere to bypass the blocked graft to in any case. Given the fact that I was extremely upset my cardiologist told me there was a possibility I could have laser angioplasty. I questioned him on how successful this procedure was likely to be, at first he said 50/50 then changed his mind and said 40/60 against. Nevertheless I thought this option was better than nothing. It was coming up to Christmas 2010 and I found I was having chest and throat pains at rest, my wife reported it to my cardiologists secretary, my cardiologist then telephone me and asked me to present myself at the hospital on Christmas Eve for another chemical stress test. I couldn't believe what he told me after having the stress test. He said that I had suffered yet another heart attack, one being prior to my bypass and the one that has just been diagnosed. On this basis he told me that the laser angioplasty was now out of the question as it appears that the site of the heart attack is where the vein is blocked off. I was prescribed nicorandil which has not made any difference but he has also now presribed me beta blockers bispropol and quite honestly I do not get along with beta blockers as all. Please excuse the long topic but can anyone tell me any surgeon/cardiologist who could possibly give me some alternatives other than medication. I am quite prepared to undergo further surgery, as I don't feel that well and could not go on feeling like this. I would just like a little bit of life back. Thanking you all in anticipation.

Both suffer from depression. my dads an abusive drunk and my mom is a drunk an addict and a postitute so you can say i have seen a fair amount of shit in my life. Im not suicdle right now but i have been, i even tryed it once. the ironic part is my mother has tryed several times to kill herself she has even done it to guilt us. (my older brother and sister) I hate my mother everything about her. the worst part is im turning out just like her. (emotionally) Below is something i wrote the other day when i was feeling really low. I thought instead of trying to write about my depression i would just show you it. I'm a little nervouse about showing it.. i guess im worried it wont make any sence to anymore.. but i have tryed everything else and this site seems pretty safe so i guess im going to give it a try. It�s agonising the way I feel, it makes perfect sense in my head but when I let it out...it�s understandable that you can�t make sense of it. I try to let it out because thoughts like these shouldn�t be locked away inside my very fucked up head. I don�t think I�ve ever felt this way before..I probably have but the emptiness I feel right now is overwhelming it�s like I don�t even have enough energy to hate myself I walk and it�s just gliding I think and its nothing I smile and I talk and its fake. Fake enough for everyone to notice yet nobody cares. Depression is a very scary and dangerous thing but then why does no body seem to interfere? I stopped smoking pot I don�t know why I guess to get myself back, ironically only to find nothing there. I understand why people need drugs alcohol...addiction, with it your something with it you feel, you see you think even if it�s not you... its better then you because without it nothing seems to matter. Who am I? Why do i try so hard to stay alive...what I am looking for what am I waiting for someone to save me? To wake up and suddenly things in life come easy. You�d tell me I have to do it for myself what you don�t realize is it�s not as simple as you think. Probably because there aren�t any clouds in your vision you can make decions. Probably because you don�t have demons pulling you down telling you you�re nothing forcing you to believe everything is your fault and there is absolutely no voice of reason. The happiest part of me is the weakest part of me it has no backup no strength. Depression is me it is my best friend it is when I feel safe, yet I�m terrified. Where is even ground? Why oh why haven�t I done it yet? It will come because if I fight it off then ill hurt everyone I love I�m simply wasting time...time which is so priceless so precious, it sound be a crime...lock me up because I�m telling you i don�t have the courage to do what needs to be done.

I have felt it just about everywhere on my chest but mostly on my left side. I would describe the pain as a dull and it usually lasts a second or two. The pain comes in periods, i have felt on and off for about an hour the longest. Before all this started i noticed a few things started to happen. For example i started to notice about two years ago that my arms and legs go numb very easy. I didnt thought much of it so i let it go. My legs and hands still go numb easily. In fact i have woken up a few times with my arms completely numb. Also, about 6 months ago i started to get pains on my thigs, behind the knee on either leg, and just a few weeks ago the same pain i have felt it on my arms, mostly on my left arm. When the pains are on my leg i cant exactly pin point where the pain is coming but when it comes to the arms im pretty sure that the pain radiates from my arm vein. These pains arent that painful, they are sharp and they last a second at the most. So what is wrong with me? i have done research and the chest stuff sounds like angina but the other pains sounds like blood clots? i mean is it possible to have multiple blood clots? or is it the same blood clot just moving around? im aware that i probably suffer from poor blood circulation. The last time i went to a doctor was about 5months ago. I went because i started to have constipation problems and i got diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.

447489161,"Combination (&gt;2 of manage, cause, or adverse findings).",No,,396628,"Post-surgery, still experiencing nasal congest., &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; difficulty breathing through mouth"," I have been a member of these boards for a few years now. I have had a mysterious breathing probem for many years too! I am going to be a sophomore in college and am 19, and I have had this breathing problem since the 7th grade since I was about 13 or 14, so please be understanding with the wealth of detail I provide (hopefully in benefit of myself and others). I was advised on this board (I don't know if it was the greatest advice in hindsight) to get my tonsils taken out to eliminate the possibility of that as they were rather large. That is..were..because I finally had them taken out on May 3rd. It has been four weeks since I had my surgery on the day of this post. In addition to my tonsils, I also had my deviated septum corrected, adenoids removed, a somnoplasty, (shrinkage of the back of the tongue) and my turbinates corrected (I should have been more questioning with this but quite honestly just wanted to get surgery because I was so darn desperate, I don't quite know what they did to my turbinates but assumed it could only be good). I have been keeping a health log, and I will tell you all of the symptoms I encountered before surgery and after. -Nasal congestion, with a nasal cycle. Sometimes the left nostril is more congested, sometimes the right nostril is more congested. I experienced this before the surgery, and still do. It makes it difficult to breathe through my nose. -Difficulty breathing through the mouth. I have a varying degree of difficulty breathing through my mouth most of the day. It is not too often I can breathe through my mouth without any congestion or difficulty. Some days are worse than others though. Before surgery though, I could never breathe without any trouble, and I think getting the surgery helped. Still though, I'm thinking acid reflux MAY be a problem, but I am still in the dark about this one. My dad has a history of acid reflux. I do hear a rumbling in my stomach at times throughout the day and feel and hear something coming up my throat, but it is rather subtle. I am taking Prilosec, but still continue to have trouble breathing through my mouth since I started taking it. Just as I was typing this, I felt a rumbling in my stomach, hicoughed, and then felt that feeling in my throat, like something was coming up my throat (but subtle). I also experience chest pains, but only on occassion. Perhaps it could be more of an internal problem? I feel like I can't get enough air in when breathing through my mouth! -I have had a problem with mucus in my throat before the surgery for several years , and actually made a makeshift garbabe can for my room (grocery bag) to spit out the mucous. I still experience that, but now instead of mucous being a problem most of the time, nasal drip is now a problem as well, and I never experienced this before. It seems like if it's not the mucous in the back of the throat I can feel and have to spit out, it is the nasal drip. There are some times throughout the day I feel neither, but I feel one or the other most of the day. I must mention that my dad is lactose intolerant, and this may be causing some of that mucous and nasal drip. I cut dairy out of my diet for a few days, and didn't really notice a difference. I will try doing that again though. -I also am sneezing a LOT more than I was in the past and my nose actually feels rather irritated throughout the day. Sometimes, it is really bad. I never felt this before the surgery. ALSO ADDED RECENTLY: I must also note my nostrils itch throughout the day and I unfortunately have to sort of get in there with my thumb and scratch it (so it kind of looks like I'm doing something else if you know what I mean :nono: ). Some days are worse than others. I am thinking that my breathing problem may be the result of one factor, but perhaps more than one factor, which makes it harder to diagnose. My brother has a history of allergies. I have been tested for allergies, but only the basic allergies and nothing came up. From reading on this board, I may be allergic to something that is subtle and not tested for often (non-allergic) which is why I have re-posted in here. Whenever I have been asked Do you have allergies by a doctor or ENT, I have always told them No. I think I should at the very least, make another appointment with a doctor to get this checked out. My whole breathing seemed to start with a severe nosebleed in 7th grade (it would not stop for a good 20-25 minutes and had me very worried and the bleeding was profuse). I am fairly certain it was from getting hit in the face with a basketball which caused my septum to deviate. However, I can not say with absolute certainty. Maybe I just have trained my mind to think that way because I have never received any solid answers for why I experience my breathing problem and the possibility of a deviated septum made some sense. Can a deviated septum have any kind of ripple effect and cause other problems than just a nasal stuffiness? I know this is long, but I have had this problem for a LONG time, and I don't know what to do, because I just don't trust doctors or feel like they care and feel like it's a waste of time. When I finally make another appt. with a doctor, I want to be more informed and be more confident in my demands instead of allowing them to blow me off like I'm nothing. I know I will never get it solved if I don't go to a doctor, but I could sure use some stories of encouragement or similar encounters, because I am starting to feel hopeless about this. I really am. I feel like the big person upstairs has turned his/her back on me or that there is no back to turn. :( P.S.-Should I go back to the ENT who performed the surgery I mentioned above, or seek an opinion from another general doctor? My health insurance (I really wish I could change the insurance I have) demands I get a referral from a PCP(personal care physician) or general doctor --I am using them interchangably, but they are the same, and they can only refer me to certain specialists-I think. I doubt I could get a referral to see a top notch ENT, but I would have to double check on this. (edited: Nope, only within the current network I am in, which at any given time, is not going to be top notch in regards to what network I'd LIKE to be in. I don't trust my current PCP who gave me the referral to the ENT I went to and he doesn't really seem to care about me all that much. I'll still be talking to him, and he'll be like motioning for me to lay down on my back and then start feeling my stomach-spend about 1 to 2 minutes with me, then go off to another patient, make me wait 5 minutes and then come back for another 2 minutes. I do more waiting in the dang room than I do receiving care from the doctor. The only reason I went to that PCP was to get a referral to that ENT (someone recommended him). I did tell the ENT I don't have allergies, but then again no allergies is such a broad statement, but you would think he'd be a bit more questioning if he really cared about me, such as asking Well, what have you been tested for? The real kicker though is this- When I choose a new PCP, I must wait until the first of the next month to make an appt. with that doctor (and still have the insurance cover the visit).

I had some baked mahi mahi for dinner, and as soon as I started eating, the entire inside of my mouth started tingling/burning. I thought it was the seasoning on the fish, so kept eating. After eating a few pieces a few spots on my lips were swollen and parts of my gums too. I started having very slight difficultly swallowing, but I talked myself into believing I was psyching myself out and calmed down a bit. After a few minutes everything was almost back to normal, though my throat is really sore and I have a slight headache. Does this sound like an allergic reaction? I've never eaten mahi mahi before, but I've had plenty of other fish and seafood. Maybe it was something in the seasoning (put on at the store)?",10,0.999963754

Less than a week after starting the pills I started experiencing bladder pain and a near constant feeling that I needed to pee. A few days after that I started to experience discomfort in my face, my tongue hurts and I think it is slightly swollen and my teeth and jaw hurt a bit. After 6 weeks my doctor thought that my problems might be side effects of the Sertraline and I was showing no signed of improved mood so he told me to stop taking it. Now I am nearly 2 weeks off the pills but I am still experiencing the same problems.

447489178,How should I manage or treat symptoms or conditions X?,No,,729589,please help me. its killing me," I am a 18 years old college students living in hostel far away from my home. i did well in my high school and i manage to get straight As. it was the most happiness and wonderful moments for me and my parents. Due to my excellent result i was offered into a local college to do my foundations in science and i accepted the scholarship cause its free and i can save my parents money. I was determined to excel in my foundations and i wanted to get all A for my subject. So i started my college day like all other students. go to lecture hall, then tutorial class, back to my room and do my homework and revision. But along with this i feel so sad and down but i tend to ignore it as i thought it must be homesick and it will gone soon, i just have to pay attention on my studies and everything will be fine.so i just study and study without bothering my thoughts and my low feelings but it is keep coming back. when i study something is telling me that im stupid and i wont make through my life and u know all sort of negative thoughts. But i fight every thought by motivating my self BUT IT ONLY LAST FOR 1 OR TWO DAYS THEN I HAVE TO START ALL OVER MY MOTIVATION PROCESS. Most of the time i cry because something is holding me from doing what i wanted ; it is some kind of lazy feeling but it is not want I wanted . Its like i want to study and be happy but the thing is stopping me . I feel useless and worthless. My heart is so heavy and empty most of the time. My roomates don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t care about each other. We don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t talk often or share same interest. One of my room mate wont close the light all night which make me hard to sleep. They are also noisy and I cant concentrate on my studies. They listen to music aloud and smack the door when they are stress. One of them always has her phone ringing for call and messages. Another roomate always talk in phone with her bf and parents for hours. But I just ignore all the distractions as I need to concentrate on my studies. So I tried a lot of ways such as study at library , at the caf� but im still sad and so tired. I try to listen to music and radio to cheer me up but it doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t last. During this time i am still studying and i manage to keep up my grades. when i go to class i pretend to be happy, i smile and laugh but inside i was bleeding. I do experience chest pain, back pain, migraine and itchiness all over my body and i went to clinic for diagnosis but the medicine dosent work accept the painkiller which really work to reduce my back pain and migraine. sometimes i was so unenergetic and weak but still i push myself to class and lecture hall.I still have friends during this time cause i was one of the smartest student in class and everyone like to refer to me for answers and as guide .I fight with my self for almost 3 month and on the 4th month i was loosing my faith and im tired of fighting with my self cause my condition become worse. At this moment i start to call my mum and tell her alll my problems but it doesnt help.i told her i cant take it anymore as im sad and loss my motivation to study but she scold and scream at me. she told me im adding burden to her and she could not sleep thinking of my problem, so i feel guilty and stop bothering her. Day by day things become worse i could not take the pressure anymore as im having this racing negative thoughts haunting me most of the time. i give up on study as it is making me more suffer. i spend another two monts watching movies and television untill midnight to forget my problems. Final exam was near and i didnt give a damn about it. During final exam l i just scribble watever i know .my heart was numb during this last two month, I cant feel, happy or sad. Then I turned to a very hot tempered person. I get angry easily and become more irratated by people around me . All my friends left me as I stop studying as they cant get any benefit from me in sense of academic. That&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;s when I discover I cant believe anyone. Most of the people are selfish and they just kick you out when ur down. My mum claim that im becoming bad and she predic it is because of friends influence but the fact is I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t even have true best friend here. I hate everyone in this world during this moment. They are not there went u need them .they suck all the good things out of u and when ur down they dump u like a trash. Even my roomates don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t care about me. They stare at me as though im a trash in this college. I found out I cant function normally anymore and I call my mum . I ask her to bring me out of this college as I want to forget everything about this place. Money is not a problem for my family so they can enroll me in any other private college. I was traumatized by this place and I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t want to remember this place even in 10 years from now . I just hope I can runaway from this place. But my mum refuse to let me out; actually it is my dad who refuse and my mum just have to follow my dad decision . She thought everything is going to be ok and it is just part of growing up. one day I was online and I search about my migraine. I pressed this MD web about health. By the side of the page there was a quiz about being sad . So I took it and I found out that I was depressed . Now everything make sense. All the sad feeling, the down, the anger, the lost of appetite, the long sleeping hours which is like almost the whole day, the feeling of dying and useless, the confusion , the lost of interest in my study and low motivation. I called my mum and told her I want to see doctor or psychiatry but she don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t believe me. During 1st semester holiday my mum bring me to a counselor but the she is making her own conclusion and prediction. She don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t want to listen to me and when I told her my problem but she sarcastically claim that im selfish and don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t think about my parents and bla, bla, bla &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8230;.. I hate her for that. She cant understand me and pressure me a lot during the counselling session. So it&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;s a fail. I went back home and no one bother about me. My mum is claiming that im pretending and acting infront of her and my dad. Things get worse I had argument with my mum and we didn&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t talk for 2 weeks. After that im back to college with no motivation and full of negative thoughts. I go to class but I cant pay attention. My mind is wandering. I write poems and song lyrics about my feelings. I listen to all sad song that kind of depressed one cause it make me feel someone is understanding me. But I have to admit I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t like the way im living but im tired of arguing with my parents and fighting with myself. So I began to accept me as who I am now. I cant remember who I am last time as I am totally different person now. Im tired of crying and seek of trying . I give up on help and thought I will be suffering like this for my whole life. I went back home for Christmas holiday and I ask my mum to bring me to a psychiatry. After 2 days of argument my parents bring me to a private psychiatry clinic. I told him my story and he gave me some antidepressant which is cymbalta and frisium . He also claimed that he will give me 10 days of MC but my mum doesnt agree as im having mid year exam the other week. So the psychiatry gave me 4 days of mc and ask me to come back on 9th of January . My mum can still think about my exam when I am sick. I told my parents I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t want to continue study there cause I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t like that place as all the past experience is haunting me back but they refuse they said that the doctor had gave me medicine and ill be ok . But I found out the antidepressant wont work in short period. So im back to my college and sitting in my hostel room. Most of the time im so weak and unenergetic. I feel so cold and wrap my self with blanket sleeping like a child the whole day. I rarely eat but I force my self to eat some cookies . Im so lonely and cold. My heart is pulling me down to earth . I cant do anything. Its hard for me to wake up in morning to go for exam .i think it must be the side effect of the drug. Today is my first day of exam and my mind is so blank. I give up and expected F for my biology test today as well as math and chemistry exam . I try to study but all I can do is stare at the words and I start crying thinking my parents don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t understand me and why my life end up this way. I think its not fair cause nothing bad happen to me to cause me depressed . I was stressed with the college life but I was actually able to cope with it and stress is normal for me as student in college. I always wonder why I become like this. Why this happen to me . Everyone is ok here but why Im so sad and down everyday. I realize that my parents care about me but they cant understand me so they scold me and shout at me. My mum is calling and asking am I studying or not. If I told her that I cant she will be worried about me and obviously scold me, so I lie to her that im ok and I had my lunch when I didn&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t actually. Then I realize no one can help me , I must help my self, so I was just waiting for my next appointment on 9th. But the waiting seem to be so long. I get tired of waiting but I want to recover, I want to be happy again, to be able to enjoy my life and motivated in my life. Deep inside I was so hurt and its painfull. I cant get my mind right and i always breakdown. I cant blame my parents. My mum is housewife and my dad is business man. They are not exposed to mental health problem. I cant blame them . Sometimes I feel that they don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t deserve me. They are wasting money on me for treatment and they are wasting there energy on me. I feel like I give them troubles. But sometimes im angry with them because no matter how hard I try to explain they don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t get it. I ask them to find about depression on internet but they are way too busy . They care about my education but they cant see that im sick and ill . Last time I wanted to become doctor .it was my dream but now I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t even know wat I want. I just want to get out of this place go somewhere to find peace but I was wondering is thre anywhere I can find peace&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8230;. My home is not right place as my parents always argue, my elder brother don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t talk to my mum since last 3 years . My other two younger sister mind there own work and another younger brother which is the last child in my family get bullied in school but he is closest to me compared to all my other siblings. My home is very noisy and chaos. My college is too scary for me . I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t know where to go. I want to run away but its impossible to run from college. All I want is some peace but I doubt whether I will find it. I even try to talk to my teacher but she cant help me too&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8230; I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t know what I should do . I wish I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t have depression . I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t have anyone to tell my problem . I just hope god will guide me through this&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8230;. Sorry for the long boring story . But I really need to express it .thank you for spending ur time reading my story .

447489671,"What is the cause of symptoms, conditions, or test findings X?",Yes,Yes,653259,Needing help or suggestions on what could be causing my chest pains," Hello everyone, I need some help or some suggestions on what could be going on possibly with my heart. I'm currently 24 years old. I don't drink or smoke. I'm not overweight but I'm not extremely fit. But I am on anxiety medication. Since 2005 I've had these strange chest pains, mostly ranging in the center or left center area of my chest. Sometimes on occasion I'll feel them on the right side of my chest or near my left shoulder blade. The pains are dull and lasts between seven and ten seconds. The pains usually are not deep, they originate and stay between the skin and the bone of my center to left chest and I've never felt these pains yet per say in my back or any lower or deeper than between where my skin ends and bone begins, which may suggest it could be coming from my nerves. Also, they apparently go away for alittle while if I rub or massage my chest. Again, the pains feel dull but they are quite constant. During 2005, when I first had these pains, I got checked out at the hospital three different times because at the time, I felt like I was developing heart issues. The main why I thought that was because of the fact I was born pre mature with a under developed heart which was supposedly closed up when I was given medicine by the doctors who delivered me. But when I was getting checked out at the hospital I remember them doing EKG's, chest x-rays, and even checking my gall bladder with a ultrasound and all the results came up negative. They and my doctor were sold on the fact that it was anxiety. But on many occasions, even during rest, I'll have these annoying chest pains. They are not unbearable or at least not yet, but I need to find out if my doctor and the medical staff at the hospital didn't miss anything. Basically, I'm asking, if you were me, considering the nature of these chest pains, are they anxiety, or something else like pinched nerves or aching muscles, or could the be indications of the early stages of heart disease? I'm not extremely scared but I am quite concerned right now. My last blood test showed that my cholesterol level was back to normal it used to be high and my blood pressure stays right around average when I'm not anxious. But anyway, I'll welcome any kind of ideas or suggestions any of you may have. Thank you all for your time",65,0.182438969

For the past four years I have been struggling with something inside me, I feel like I'm coming closer and closer to insanity each day...sometimes even death. Theres something in my head...a voice...anyones voice, sometimes even my own, and it mocks me. Tears me apart in every way. It makes up these crazy scenarios that couldn't possibly be real and I try my hardest to think the opposite and to talk myself down from it, but the things that go through my head make me feel like nothing... I get so incredibly upset and sometimes its over something that didn't even happen... I can't get it to stop. It disrupts relationships that I have with people almost on a daily basis, my family and my boyfriend are the only people I communicate with. I am extremely paranoid about people... I don't like being out in public by myself or having to talk to anyone. I always feel like people are following me, or theres some kind of presence there thats after me. I feel like theres someone there that I don't know and they know everything about me and that they know what awful things I think.. it feels like they are going to take me away some where and either torture or kill me! I have to go to college in about a week and the thought of sitting in that room with all those other people and being there makes me cry and even makes me contemplate running away....just getting in my piece of crap car and just going until I can't go anymore. When something happens to me thats upsetting all kinds of things start popping up in my head. Just driving my car as fast as I can go until I hit a tree or telephone poll.... anything. I've tried to drown myself and I tried to strangle myself once too. I've been with my boyfriend for over a year now and I truly do love him. He trusts me and protects me. I trust him too....but the voices don't trust anyone... not even me. I don't like them and I feel taunted all the time by them. They complicate things between us and it breaks my heart. I try to explain but... I just can't. I cannot stand females and if any girl tries to talk to me or my boyfriend, I'm very rude to them. I don't want anything to do with life anymore... I really don't know how to shake these feelings. I understand that feeling down sometimes is normal...but all the time?...I can't take much more of this and sometimes life seems pointless. I know taking my own life is selfish... but a wise person once said, sometimes you have to be selfish in order to be happy. I don't have the money to go to the doctors...I'm afraid of what they will say to me or that they will diagnose me with something thats incorrect... I don't know what I have though. I am depressed, I hear things that aren't really there, I'm paranoid, and sometimes after an episode 5 minutes later it will be like nothing ever happened. I can go from being on the verge of knocking myself out somehow to being fine a minute later... or vis versa. What can I do? :(",44,0.748294331

The pain can range from dull to intense with no apparent cause or reason. The pain is located basically at my heart and it feels internal to my ribcage. I�ve been to multiple doctors, specialist etc. with no help. I�ve had blood work, multiple EKG�s, a CT scan with contrast of my chest, stress test, electrocardiogram, multiple chest X-rays, oxygen level test, and a endoscope. I�ve been cleared (and told I was in good health) by 2 ER doctors, my family doctor, my GI doctors, and my cardiologist. They all diagnosed me with stress. I do sometimes feel stress and sometimes I even feel like I�m having a panic attack but it seems to come on without a discernable cause. (For example sometime bad will happen and I will have bad chest pain 4 days later.) The only thing that seems to help the pain is to stay very active both mentally and physically to keep my mind off of the pain. Working out vigorously seems to help. In order to treat the possible anxiety issues I�ve tried martazipine, lexapro, prestiq, lorazepam, and wellbutrin � none of which seem to help. In order to fight possible acid reflux � I�ve tried zantac, carofate, prevacid and kapidex. � none of which seem to help. I�ve taken anti-inflammatory medicine and rest in case the pain was caused by costochondritis or tietze syndrome. I�ve seen chiropractors to see if the pain was due to back trouble.

For about a year my left breast has been more tender than my right. I chalked it up to my period. Around the time of my period a lump would show up and there would be an achy pain. In June the pain lasted for two weeks before my period started til after my period ended. July 3 weeks, and in August it came and never went away. I had my yearly exam and He checked and said it has a knotty look to it. Told me for the time he was going to classify it as Mastitis and told me to take Advil 2x a day for 10 days, and Vitamin E 2x a day for 30 days. He also sent me for a mammogram and a sonogram. They both came back normal. My breast feels like it is on fire. I started putting ice packs on it for 8hrs a night. I also had a kidney stone which resulted in a UTI. They put me on antibiotics, and the burning sensation went away, but the pain was still there along with a lump that I can clearly feel. The mammogram and sonogram came back normal. The pain is literally so bad I could cry, and is now sending pain radiating into my armpit area and shoulder. It is a achy soreness all the time. I cannot sleep on my stomach at night. It feels a lot fuller than my right side, and the burning is starting to come back. They weren't going to see me back until Oct 25th, but the pain is so bad I called today, and they scheduled me for tomorrow. I just have to have this pain go away.

I was never sure what was wrong with me until I decided to do some reasearch. My father is an alchoholic and was sober for 7 years. There was always a fear in me that he would have a relapse, and sure enough it happened just around thanksgiving. It started off slow but progressed into horrible addiction again. I don't live with him, but it still affects me having to know he may screw up his whole life. The symptoms I had that I thought may be depression have seemed to get a lot worse since all of this mess. I feel hopeless, like life is meaningless and boring. I'm never completely happy with anything. It takes A LOT to amuse me. Just going out with my friends isn't enough. If I find myself having fun, shortly after I'll get bored and just want to go home. Once I'm home, I'll want to go out again. When I do go out again, I'll want to go home or just feel bored and sometimes almost lifeless. I seem to be tired all the time. I dont have much trouble sleeping. Most nights I'll sleep at least 7 hours. I tend to sleep a lot when I'm home and if I don't have to wake up I'll just stay in bed. I can't say I've though about suicide, only because I know how devastated my family would be. Not to mention the fact I'm pretty scared of death. I have, however, felt at times that I wouldnt mind being dead. Life seems to be so tedious and pointless sometimes. I also tend to get very iritable with people I love for no reason. No matter how hard I try to control it, I can't. I seem to get tired of people easily as well. I am nervous a lot for no reason at all. I always think the worst.

In early November, I visited my GYN for my yearly exam and nothing was felt. However, on November 16th I accidentally discovered a lump behind my nipple. I went back to the GYN and she still could not feel the lump. That's because she did not check the nipple area! Why not?! After I showed her where it was, she felt it. She told me it was nothing to worry about, but ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed an abnormal mass behind the nipple. I was then referred to a General Surgeon who recommended a Core Biopsy. He said he didn't recommend removal (unless it was cancerous) since the lump was in such a precarious location. I had the Biopsy on Dec. 4th and am waiting for the results.

After the hospital fixed the typo and said there was only a cyst in the left one , I called his office and told them about the discharge being there still along with a knife-like sharp pain. They said just to wait until my recheck in a few months. So since it was really hurting I went to another doc about it. He said I have fibrocystic breast disease.

447489210,How should I manage or treat symptoms or conditions X?,No,,727238,Can anyone relate??," Hi, New here on the board. I have suffered from depression for most of my life (I am 40), Had a big turnaround about 17 years ago, when I went on Prozac. The med totally changed my life for the better. I went back to grad school (I had dropped out due to depression), got my degree, got a good job and got married. Things have gone downhill from there. My marriage was shaky from the start &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8211; constant fighting and tension. My wife has a terrible anger issue and is constantly baiting me into fights. She by any objective view, is downright mean to me. I believe that she needs to get some professional help, but she just won&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t do it. She says, that she doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t have a problem and that her anger is normal. I have also had some health problems myself and issues with pain medication (self medicating my depression) as well as the underlying depression. I am sure it has been no picnic for her. I will give her that. We now have two kids (great kids). They are little miracles. Having kids, I would consider a divorce to be the worst thing imaginable. The thought of not being with my kids to tuck them in at night and to get them breakfast in the morning, makes me feel utter despair. However, my marriage is not a good one. Can it get better? I hope so. I love them to death. Another downer is that my dad is dying. He is bed ridden and only occasionally lucid. And now it is Christmas!! It is supposed to be a happy time of the year. The expectation of happiness just compounds the feelings of sadness though. I do have to put a good show on for my kids. They deserve a happy house. I have tried &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8216;talk therapy&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;, but it just seems like a waste of time, because they (the psychologists) all seem to be so dispassionate and analytical and the tips are all out of a psychology 101 book. My last counselor said I should just leave my wife. Yeah, easier said than done. How about breathing exercise? Ok, I will give that a shot. Nope. Positive imagery? Anything else. Oh, meditation. Hmmm&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8230;Ok, that&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;s it. Same with ADs have tried them all. Hoping the one I am on now makes a difference. We&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;ll see.

It seems I had a reaction to it that causes me to, for lack of a better description, feel like I really need to burp, but can't. There is a terrible pressure at the bottom of my sternum, like I said, enough to double me over. It seemed at first like there was some type of obstruction, so I drank more beer to try to clear it, I pressed my chest into the arm of a sofa, still nothing. Of course the next time I drank beer I had the same reaction, and ever since. My wife has the occasional beer, keeps it in the fridge all the time, and I long for it. I have several times just taken a swig, sloshed it around and my mouth, and spit it out in the sink/yard etc just to get a taste of it (believe it or not it is relatively refreshing). When I do that I most likely swallow less than 1/4 oz - it is impossible not to swallow a tiny bit, and I have occasionally reacted to that tiny amount. The reaction is less than what it was when I was trying to drink it down, the reaction is generally in line with the amount that I drink. I have taken several obvious steps to counter this problem: 1. I now drink only whisky 2. I have taken several OTC medications including an anti-gas medication, anti heartburn (zantac), and benadryl, all well prior to drinking and all to no effect. I can drink flavored beer - the malted Mikes Hard Lemonade, the Triple Black stuff, et al. I am pretty sure it is not Celiac Disease as I have no other symptoms. I can drink cokes or other carbonated beverages. Can anyone shed some light on this issue? Is there a magic pill out there that I can take, is there a diagnosis you are aware of?

The pain is somewhat central in the chest and it seems to climb up into the area of my neck where you would check your pulse. I've gone to the hospital twice, once for atrial fibulation and once for chest pain, but they concluded nothing as to why this happened on both visits.

I have been in a committed relationship for over 5 years with a wonderful man who suffers from depression. He is very upfront and aware about his depression, and generally manages it pretty well with medication and a good understanding of what he needs to do for himself when he gets into a bad place emotionally. Although I am closer to this man than I have ever been to anyone else in this world, he was wary of moving in together for many years, in part because I have a child and he did not want to subject her and I to the dark side of his moods and his need to be alone when things get really bad. However, a year ago we finally took a deep breath and combined households. Things have been mostly OK, but two days ago he and my 11 year old daughter had a blowout argument over her messiness (he is very neat) and the drama seems to have put him into an emotional tailspin. He showed an angry side of himself that he does not like to show, and after storming out of the house, and then storming back in, he said he was sorry and then went to bed, where he has been for 2 days. I can barely get a response from him. He won't eat and has not bathed. I asked him if he would consider going to see his doctor and his response was can we just not talk about this . I am very aware that there are long term issues as to whether I can make this cohabitation arrangement work for my child, my partner and me in the long term, but I am not even there yet and with respect, that's not what I hope to get replied about. Right now I am just frightened for him and at a loss to know what the right thing is to do for him. He is not suicidal as far as I can tell, just completely uninterested in getting out of bed. He tells me he is fine and to leave him alone. Should I let this go for a while longer and see if he comes around? Or try to force the issue of getting some help? This has all been happening during a weekend so I have yet to see whether he will pull himself together for the sake of the workweek. He is self employed and normally very dilligent about his work but its hard for me to envision him putting in a full day tomorrow given that he has been horizontal for 48 hours with no signs of change.

I was taught how to pre-empt an attack of palpitations after a missed heart beat by taking a really deep breath and holding it. But yesterday this didn't work and the ensuing violent palpitations lasted 10 minutes - at least -and they were all in my midriff area. During the pause I nearly blacked out as I didn't take that breath in quick enough. It was horrible. Now I'm really worried as my father died of a burst aortic aneurism and my brother had a heart bypass years ago when he was still quite young. I had an ECG a month ago for a totally unrealated symptom and my GP said it was fine. A doctor at the hospital also did an ECG a few months back as I had a really bad chest pain but she too said everything was fine. (But she said she could see all the little electrical impulses along the graph denoting ectopics but nothing to worry about - just part of my make-up). But is it normal to get palpitations like this in the midriff area? They were really violent. And does anyone else suffer from this sort of thing? I keep reading about people who get palpitations and people who get ectopics but not one following the other which I've always suffered with. Anyway thank you for any replies.

447472497,"What is the cause of symptoms, conditions, or test findings X?",Yes,Yes,855570,Anxiety causing depression?," First of all I'm new to the site, my first post. to give a background on my condition I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. before middle/highschool it was very tolerable, for example I was afraid to be alone or anxious that I might never learn to tie my shoes. after moving up to middleschool my anxiety increased and school became a trigger. highschool brought more challenges, and in 9th grade I was hit by what I percieved to be depression. After some time I just decided life was worth living and with determination and the hope I invested in the future, I was able to start appreciating things again. during the time of my mild depression my anxiety was somewhat debilitating, but about 6 months ago it went through the roof. I experienced depersonalization/derealization and anxiety attacks (at school) like never before, I also lost faith in many things I found security in, including friends and family, I was floating through space with no anchor and no where to go. School was a huge trigger for me, making schoolwork seem unimportant. when my grades dropped I endured daily criticism from my mom and felt very unloved. this, partnered with the distance I felt from my friends, lead me to seek therapy and medication. the doc said I was likely to have anxiety/depression together so I began on Valium and Zoloft. That took me away from the anxiety brink and gave me a strange day to day high feeling. after 2 months I stopped taking zoloft by choice, and my therapist suggested trying to get a real diagnosis from a psychiatrist. He insisted that I stop taking valium because my brother is an addict. (I had also had my meds stolen several times) I told the psychiatrist I wasn't feeling depressed, It was more that my anxiety could cause stress, mild apathy, and disappointment from time to time. Even so, he put me on Paxil with abilify which made me very irratable and I got into a few fights along with other side effects and no anxiety relief. I complained about this and he told me to stop the meds and take buspar. this has helped with stress and prevents the harsher anxiety effects, but its not really a big help. When I returned for the last time, the nurse practitioner said I have the facial appearance of depression and pushed cymbalta. I feel like ssri's arent the answer, and cymbalta has made me feel nothing other than nausea and irritability. I don't know where to turn, and I am afraid for what my senior year of school will bring. Sorry for the long post, any type of response or advice is welcome.",44,0.0945981

When I first felt it I got scared for a few minutes, then went into the bathroom and looked at my breast. There was a small bruise right below it. I have a large dog that likes to jump up and that is where she lands a lot I think. So I decided it was from the bruise. I waited a couple days and it was still there so I went to see my doctor on Friday afternoon. In the mean time, I am adopted, and talked to my biological sister and found out that my maternal grandmother died of breast cancer, an aunt died of ovarian cancer, my sister and niece have cervical cancer and my brother has stomach cancer. So the doctor did an exam and said he was sure it was just a cyst. But based on the family history, I should get a mammogram and ultrasound. I am almost 43 (Saturday will be my birthday, whoohooo! Happy birthday to me!) and my last mammogram was last July, so they did the regular one Tuesday and one extra view of my right breast, then did the ultrasound.

But I hope some of you here who use Lasix/furosemide will answer me anyway with your experience taking this stuff for edema: How many milligrams do you take? How soon after you take it do you have to go? How well does it control your edema? I have pitting edema in both ankles, no known cause, been tested for pretty much everything, and I've tried everything known to man to fix it but nothing's worked: compression stockings, elevation, very low sodium diet, recumbent bike, pedal exerciser under my desk during the day...you name it, I've done it. My doctor finally put me on Lasix. I am relatively small (except for my ankles), 5 ft 3 in and 115 lbs. I started with 10mg (half a 20mg tablet) every other day. I took it the first day, didn't have to urinate for at least an hour after I took it, and although eventually I ended up going more than I normally do in a day I never had to go that bad and barely lost any fluid retention. After about a week and a half we stepped it up to 10 mg every day. Same thing, took it in the AM, didn't even have to urinate for like 2 hours and still had swollen ankles all day. A week and a half later, up to the full 20 mg tablet. Took it in the AM, didn't have to go for almost an hour and a half, went a bit more than normal, barely noticeable difference in my ankles. So today I decided to try 40mg. I took it at 8 AM and didn't even have an urge to go until almost 10 AM. And my ankles are maybe a bit less swollen, but still awful looking. Oh, and I've been weighing myself every morning to see if I am actually losing any water weight. I'm not. In fact, a couple of days I weighed nearly 2 lbs more than I did the day before. I don't really care what I weigh, I'm just checking to see if there's any difference due to water weight loss. Am I doing something wrong with this stuff? I'm beyond frustrated with it. I keep reading how people take it and have to urinate almost continuously for the next 90 minutes and have increased urge to go for several hours. Why isn't it doing that to me?

And to thank leea for her support. HOpe I spelled that right. lol . I have to admit I was soo nervous! They had my mammogram pics from last week up on the board and I could see what they were talking about. there was a place that was easy to see. The tech did more mammogram pics and used a smaller paddle and squished the snot outta me. didn't really Hurt so much as uncomfortable. I asked her if what they found might be fibrocystic? and she said Well there is definetly something there:confused: boy that scared me! and made me pray even harder. Then I had to go back to the room and wait for them to come get me for the ultrasound. Seemed like forever! Thank God the ultrasound tech was so sweet and for a little bit couldn't even find what the Dr had been concerned about. Then found it. She kept saying that it looked Fatty to her. She finished and the Dr came in. she was really nice too. She took a look and told me that the place looked Smooth and was a Fibro-adenoma. or something like that. Anyway it is a cyst. She said that she wasn't worried about it. Apparently it was there Last year when I got my first baseline mammogram! but that breast center apparently wasn't concerned! She said she could see it on the old films and it didn't look like it had grown. She told me that if I was worried that they could do a Needle biopsy or wait for 6 months to come backin. Since she wasn't worried I opted to wait. I go back in in 6 months. Right after my birthday. I can't tell you what an incredible blessing I got today.

447472280,"What is the cause of symptoms, conditions, or test findings X?",No,,827667,PVC's or something else??, I am 49 yr old female and have had ectopics for over 20 yrs sometimes very badly like eveyry 3rd beat- have had frequent 24hr holters and also an echo and always told harmless but horrible. In past few years they had improved hugely. I have always noticed that very occasionally I would get a split second flutter in my chest and my heartrate would speed up afterwards but as they only lasted literally a second and I have had them for as long as the ectopics and not very often I assumed they must be connected. As I said my ectopics had improved greatly and I had gone months with only noticing maybe one or two a day when one day three months ago I had eaten a very big meal bought for me by a friend ( so felt obliged to eat everything) and was feeling very full and I was bent forward slightly over the table talking to her when I got the fluttery feeling in my chest- this time it didn't just last a second - I took a deep breath and coughed as this can stop my ectopics but it didn't work - the fluttery feeling lasted about 5 seconds and I then felt faint and my heart was racing and I had to rush for the loo (bowels). A week later again after I had a full stomach about 5 mins after I had finished eating and again I was bent forward slightly when the fluttering started again - once again it lasted more than a second again about 5-6 seconds and again I felt very strange afterwards with fast heartbeat and again the need to rush to the loo. This time the person I was with panicked and called an ambulance and I was taken to A E. I had a fast heartbeat (130) but as I am very anxious person this is common when I feel at all nervous and hospital means nervous! They monitered me for 3 hrs and Dr decided that it was probably to do with my ectopics and my ecgs and monitering was all normal other than fast ( it was funny as the Dr approached me my heartrate went up!). After one of these events I have more ectopics than usual for a few days. I had another 24hr ecg a few weeks later and had my normal ectopics but nothing worrying showed up on it. I saw cardiologist last week and he said it was unlikely to be anything harmful and could be being triggered by my stomach but he would prefer to capture it on tape so 30th Dec I am having an even moniter for 3 weeks so that if I get it again I can hold device to chest to record it- I am sure its not going to happen though! Last night I had eaten alot of chocolate and had one alcoholic drink ( I never drink alcohol normally) and again had just finished eating and was bending forwards slightly listening to what was being said when the fluttering cam again- coughand breath did not stop it but this time I tried to feel my pulse and all I felt was an increased heartrate but not excessive. Once again I felt strange headed and had to rusht to the loo. The hospital Dr said that the rushing to the loo showed an adrenalin response in other words I panicked so it was hard to tell if the feeling faint was caused by the heartflutter or anxiety about the fluttery feeling. I just wondered if anyone on here gets anything similar- there is a def connection between full stomach and my body position and this happening.,65,0.864144059

Now a days i am suffering from minor depression want someone who i can share myself and get a mutual emotional ventilation As i myself enjoy seeing my father having sex with my mother.i also want to suck him. i have been having this problem since adolescent.As i used to masturbate a lot so i thought that my penis was not getting proper erection. I discussed it with him and did my pents down before him . he used to look at my fully erect penis but he did not offer any emotional help. even he did not say least that my erection is normal. i used to call him in my room and down my pents and ask him if my erection was normal. he used to come but said nothing . it means that he enjoyed seeing my erect penis.At 16 i was so sex deprived that i used to picture my fathers friend having sex with me. at around 22 i was sleeping one night it was around 2 in night . as it was summer my father and mother were sleeping in open but i was in room.i saw my father call my mother inside she came and then she lie down on carpet. my father wanted her to go one room inside .they went inside . my father dropped his shorts and now he is completely nude. he then hug my mother .kiss her suck her Breast. press her breast. he then up her legs looking at vagina he inserted his finger into the vagina as his hairless penis was standing full. he inserted the penis and start stroking.then finally he ejaculate and hug each other. i enjoy this picture at the time of masturbation. my grandfather was a sexual pervert he used to show me his penis i think he enjoyed showing his penis .one i saw him an my grand mother hugging each other . i used to sleep them and in dark room i felt many times having sex. in dark room they used to have sex and i used to masturbate. though now i have had sex with few males and suck their penis also . i was also got sucked but i did not enjoy it.at the same time i enjoy seeing nude males at internet more then nude girls. i want to see their hips and penile hair along with penis. i do these searches more then i do for nude female. for them i enjoying having not seeing . i also enjoy discussing parental sex with one of may friend who is said to have witnessed his parents having sex at 26. i feel that i need to tell someone like you otherwise i will never have emotional ventilation.beside sexual problem i have other problems too but first i want to discuss it. i am reading a book on psychotherapy in which i got to know that it is one of the technique of psychotherapy to tell someone what u r feeling. another technique is to change the stimuli/result. now i will try to picture my girl friend as having sex during masturbation. what should i do when i feel like talking about parental sex. i will try to write something on the board and u have to help me. another problem is that i am a Sr. Test Engineer working with an MNC and they have given me the notice period of 2 months to find another job. due to this i am also feeling tension. though i am quite hopeful that i will get a job before two months. another thing i feel very angry with my father that he had not loved me . my childhood memories are full of love deprivation. though now i am more mature than a child but still i feel a gap in my personality. i feel very illustrated that he produced so many , seven children and all of us more or less has the same feeling. though he was aware of family planning as he used to tell in his office that he had two children . which his coworker told when he visited our family. as i was not allowed to go outside during adolescent (another cruelty on my childhood). during adolescent as everybody is preoccupied about sex i used to masturbate a lot and feel guilty about it. i remember sometime i used to check his cupboard for condoms. i remember that sometime i found empty packets of condoms it means he knew about condoms . he used to wear condoms during sex but not regular as shown by empty packets of condoms. i have anger for him that he did not wear condoms regularly just to enjoy sex.so my anger is that he produced us just for having sex and did not thing that we need his love and emotional attention. i sometime feel jealous with him thinking that he enjoyed every kind of sex including homosexuality and deprived me from growing normal just closing me in house only to study. as when i was in my teens i remember that sometime he used to come with his male friend and used to sleep in the drawing room and closing room from inside. that means he used to have sex with them. once upon a time a guest come he slept on double bed with my fathers friend in the night . in the morning guest told me that his friend put his hand in my short and hold my penis and took that to his anus. it means he wanted to be fucked .that also imply that my father used to insert his penis in his anus. so i feel very un-happy for it.i am 33 and i have taken heterosexual only once that to with a call girl.that assured me of my sexual potency. though i remember that her vagina was very loose and i did not make any effort in inserting penis in to vagina, i was able to enter her in just one stroke.I WANT TO ASK YOU IF IT IS SO EASY TO ENTER IN VAGINA , IN JUST ONE STROKE.

He recently has gone downhill pretty quickly and was hospitalized again for 8 days. This time he was stablized but did not get much better, the way he normally does after iv diruetics, and had paracentesis done on his abdomen. They were not able to get all the fluid out of his body, but they did discharge him. he has now been home for about 4 days and is acting very strange. He seems confused, tired, and disconnected. He gets angry and agitated one minute and then acts like a child the next. He avoids eye contact. Half the things he says is just jibberish and doesnt even make sense. He says he should have stayed in the hospital, but then refuses to go back or call his doctor. I read somewhere that this could be due to the lack of oxygen in his blood?? Is the CHF causing this? What should my family do to help him? Any help would be appreciated! Thanks",65,0.193169213

My gyno was checking my breasts and rather quickly grabbed my hand and said do you feel that? and I did. I'm 30 years old... Never been pregnant. Always have had abnormal periods, despite being on the pill. My mom had a cyst removed from one of her breasts when she was in her late 20s, and there's no history of breast cancer in our family. But I'm still quite worried. There are no exterior signs of anything being wrong. I'm feeling a bit of soreness, but that might be all in my head. It's not severe, but it's there. It hurts in my underarm area (which I started worrying about - thinking lymph nodes - but I read somewhere else on here that that could be from the fact that I'm constantly trying to find the lump and such with that arm and I'm stretching funny... hopefully that's the case). The lump is big... probably chicken nugget sized and seems to be attached to what I think is my milk duct. I can put my hand around it and move it, but but it seems attached to the structure in my breast that I think is the milk duct. My doctor recommended that I see a mammography specialist/surgeon but didn't tell me much other than the fact that this happens to a lot of women and don't worry. But I'm worrying. I'm not sure what I expect from all of you, but I just had to tell someone. My mom and boyfriend know but I just feel like I need more of a sounding board... that's how I deal with things.

So it might be garbled, boring and long. Sorry. Im a mum of 3. My eldest daughter is 16. She is a great kid. One i am very proud of. She has just told me 3 days ago that she is depressed, and its something she has been dealing with for a number of years. She could have floored me. I had NO idea! She is a happy, funny, smart, fantastic young lady. I almost wanted to say rubbish your fine. But of course I didnt. So I listened, wondering where the hell I went wrong. Then thinking of all the things I have done wrong as a parent. And knowing its all my fault. Feeling bad, that I havent protected her from this, havent been a good enough parent to give her coping skills with stress etc.....then I had to remember, this ISNT about me. She just wants help, she wants to tell me how SHE is feeling. And asking for my help. What do I do??? She wants to kill herself....my beautiful little girl. who I have always thought had the best head on her......wants to kill herself..??? She feels worthless, then feels guilty for feeling worthless....she feels sick of being perfect...then feels guilty for that. She feels like killing herself, then feels guilty because she knows what that would do to her family. It would kill us. She feels bad because she says she knows girls that have broken families, and they are not depressed, they cope. She feels bad because she has a good life, her words... good parents, no reason to be sad . But she is, and then she feels worse because she shouldnt feel bad. I dont know what to do. I took her to the GP and they offered her drugs....but she knows how I feel about that, so refused. so eventually the doctor gave her a test, and a referal to Headspace . I called for an appointment. Early next week. I told her if she feels she cannot cope, tell me and I will take her back to the GP.... I dont get why she is soooooo hung up on getting drugs. She said she needs it. She feel she has been trying to deal with this for years, and now its out of control. I feel she can try other things. Ive spent the last 2 nights up on the net looking for info, and found out that lack of sleep can be a major factor in depression. Well I know my daughter has for years had trouble sleeping. For instance, she will go to bed after midnight, after us pushing her.....and then not sleep till 3 or 4 in the morning. So I want to ask her doctors about that first....could that be the problem? Could it be hormones??? Could it be a combination of both??? Shouldnt we explore that before anti-depressants? Am I wrong? Is she so good at hiding it, that she NEEDS them just to cope?? And what if she does go down the drug track?? Will it be forever? Will she become a zombie? Will she learn to cope with life, or will she ALWAYS need them? I have friends who are on them and they cannot cope with life, on or off the pills, and some have had electric shock treatment......she is not normal now. She cannot remember who she spoke to last week, let alone look after herself anymore. She spends her days in a mental health home.

It comes on sharp and also at the same time it seems to shoot down into my groin area on the right side too. I feel a little sickly and nausea but have not been sick , think that is just with the other feeling i have which is constant belching every few minutes trying to get wind up like indigestion. I have taken now for year omeprazole for bleeding ulcers i once had and just on a maintenance dose now with that tablet. Was not sure if to take another one to see if it eases it or just go to bed and hope it is gone for morning. when the pain comes it like takes the breath out of mer only for the time the pain is on then it is okay again. I am just agitated and nervous with it and been trying to suck a mint see if that helps but nothing so far. It's been on now on and off I would say a good 6 to 7 hours. Forgot to mention 2 years ago they thought I had a pulmonary embolism, was in hospital a week on heparin. One test they did that made them think it came back off the scale they said. Anyway they said after different scans it was not that so i am unsure what caused it. One doctor who came around said something about coagulation while hew was talking to the other doctors but not sure what was meant by it. they were going to keep me in to get my blood pressure down but it never happened, I was on tablets once but they made me breathless so he took me off them. my blood pressure usually is 120 or higher over 190 or higher. not all the time it sometimes is 100 or lower over 160 ish. The only other thing unusual the last two days is a pressure feeling on my temples which I put down to blood pressure as it makes me feel flushed hot in the face.

447472427,"Combination (&gt;2 of manage, cause, or adverse findings).",No,,747885,"Heart Palpitations, Chest and Head Discomfort, Please Help!"," Hi forum, my name is Peter and I�m 23 years of age. For the last two months I have been suffering from palpitations and various forms of discomfort in my back and chest which are unfortunately causing me to become very anxious and are greatly affecting my quality of life. The problems first started when I was spending a few months away from home on business in America, I had been out the evening before and had consumed perhaps four or five cans of Red Bull mixed with vodka although had not been particularly drunk that evening as I had been drinking fairly large amounts of water in-between drinks. The next day, whilst sitting at my desk at about mid afternoon, I started getting the sensation of what felt like a very rapid and pounding heart beat, and so I journeyed to the nearest ER dept. in the area. My heart rate was beating at about 120 bpm when I was received into the clinic (I expect it was doing perhaps a little more whilst I was en-route). Upon arrival I was given an EKG test � which proved to be normal � and when my heart had calmed down sufficiently I was released. Over the four weeks that followed I made a further four trips to the ER room for much the same reason � although I had cut to virtually zero my alcohol and caffeine consumption as per the doctor�s advice � suffering primarily palpitations but the occasional sharp twinge of pain in the far left side of my chest (a symptom which has now disappeared). When I returned to the UK from America I visited a Harley St. cardiologist who performed a further EKG, a stress-EKG, a cardio-graphic assessment (showing my ejection fraction � 67%), and wore a Holter and a seven-day event monitor. I also had at various times blood tests showing � from what I can remember � my potassium levels and the adrenaline production of my thyroid gland (for which a urine sample was taken). Further to that my blood pressure is normal, and I had at one point a CAT scan of my chest using illuminating dye to determine whether a blood clot was responsible for my problems (as during one of the five sets of blood tests I had done it was reported that a certain marker was present � the details I can�t recall), and I have also had numerous chest x-rays. All the tests which were performed looked completely normal and there was not at any point a cause for concern discovered. The cardiologist explained to me that the heart structure and rhythm looked perfectly normal and that there was nothing sinister discovered on any front. The problem is that I still continue to get the palpitations, albeit less intensely than before, and so I was hoping that perhaps if I could put some questions to the experienced people here (both to any doctors and to people who have had similar experiences!) that my concerns might be further alleviated. My questions, broadly speaking, are: 1)I have been getting feeling of pressure, tenseness, cloudiness and general discomfort inside my head � particularly in the upper and lower jaw , sinuses and temples � for the last few weeks (noticeably) but on and off for the last couple of years. The pressure comes and goes and doesn�t feel particularly like it should be heart related although it does sometimes accompany the palpitations but usually outlasts them by some hours. Is it possible that this is heart related? I notice also that when my interest and attention levels are particularly piqued (rather than forced for the sake of i.e. work), the discomfort is often absent (although I don�t know if it is dispelled if already present). 2)I have been feeling sharp discomfort in my lower neck region (upper back I suppose!), left and right sides of my chest, shoulders and mid-to-upper back. The pain in my neck is made worse by moving my head backwards as if to look up, and the pains elsewhere can often by stimulated by pressing on the affected area so it appears to be surface pain predominantly (I presume heart pain would be deeper and likely more concentrated). Could this be related? A gut feeling is that this pain in particular � which has only been with me for about a week � is stress or tension related. 3)I have been for the last year very disillusioned with the work that I do and myself in more general terms, and am leaving the company which I work for (for the last six years) to take a break and try and remedy these feelings. I am also very anxious (even stressed) about various things � mostly related to uncertainty about religious and other existential questions � about which my parents who raised me were very certain and very strict in their adherence, and which I have recently come to feel more skeptically about (albeit in a guilty and tentative fashion). Is it possible that this anxiety and these negative feelings on the while could be causing the palpitations � although I should mention these played less on my conscience before the palpitations first started than they do now? 4)I sometimes get tingling in my hands, usually both hands at once, although suspect that this is related to ulna nerve compression resulting from mild damage which I did to the nerve about five years ago. The tingling doesn�t feel quite the same as the tingling which I had become accustomed to after the nerve was first compressed, but it does seem to be intensified when I am using my hands for things such as typing. Is it possible that this is related? Your help, insights and answers are greatly appreciated � you have no idea how much this has been on my mind lately!",65,0.196172849
447489206,"What is the cause of symptoms, conditions, or test findings X?",Yes,Yes,840931,Can anyone identify or help me with why this occurs?," This is perhaps one of the oddest things, but it's in a very mild form (yet still quite distressing). I'm not even sure where to begin, or if this is sure-fire an allergic reaction. Whenever my face, or body physically touches oil, or fats such as in lotions/soap my eyelids will swell up. They are not in pain whatsoever, nor do any rashes or serious happenings occur, and they simply just droop. How much they droop depends on how much lotion/whatever was used on my skin. It's not very noticeable, but after prolonged periods of time it becomes difficult to look up and my forehead feels stressed because my eyelids become somewhat heavy. No, it's not the certain ingredients within the lotion/soap or material, it's ANYTHING fat or fat related. Even products with wheat protein or glycerine will set it off. While it's definitely possible to live with this and it does not affect my life that significantly, you can see why it can be so aggravating. Almost all cosmetic, or things that can become necessary in some seasons like chap stick are unavoidable and contain fats. Now what I don't understand is why I have this condition, because no one else in my family seems to have it, meaning it's probably not genetic unless I don't know about someone related to me that does. And how can oil or fats trigger this, when your body naturally produces oils and fats within and on your very own skin? This really is a personal matter to me, and I'm not taking it lightly. I want to figure out the cause of it, or at least identify what it is, if an allergy at all. I have never heard of this, and it seems almost unnatural and completely bizarre that my body is reacting like such. Thanks in advance. Edit: I can actually eat whatever I want and it won't trigger it at all, which might help in finding out some things. Digesting oil/fats doesn't affect it.",10,0.376748496
447489642,"What is the cause of symptoms, conditions, or test findings X?",No,,831027,Bloody Discharge - Comes and Goes," On Christmas Eve, I came home from church and went to change my clothes. When I took off my bra I noticed a bunch of blood spots in the left side cup. When I went to check where it was coming from I had blood dripping from my left nipple. When you wiped it away it would just bubble up again. It did eventually stop that night. But, the next day it happened again and the next day again. Then it stopped for a week and happened again a little more than a week ago. I saw my dr who sent me down for a mammo and u/s. Both were fine but he said my breasts are very dense and bleeding like that is not normal. I also have a condition which makes me more prone to lung and breast cancer. He said he was concerned and set me up an appt with a surgeon. I saw the surgeon. And left very upset. Before he even examined me he told me he thought everything was fine and we should just watch it. Needless to say I was still nervous. So, I made an appt at the Mayo Breast Clinic. They got me in the next day with a GREAT doctor. They reviewed my records from home but wanted to do some different shots, and then another mammo and u/s. I found that I had WAY more cysts than thought! I also had been having a dark green, almost black discharge on my right side as well. I then had my appt back with my dr after all the tests. She told me that they are not worried about the discharge on my right side. She said that that was just how my body was. But then she said the left side (where I have been bleeding) was a different story. She said that the mammo and u/s ok but that wasn't the end of the story. She said that I shouldn't be having bloody discharge like that and we needed to keep going until we figure out why it is happening. So, this Thurs I go back and meet with a surgeon. She told them no same day surgery, to schedule anything for another appt...what would they be doing? She said they may want to do an MRI first...before what? I am a little scared. She wasn't able to produce any blood. But the days it has come it was like I had just sliced my finger for the amt that would come out. And it was BRIGHT red and it was coming from one spot on my nipple. I haven't had any discharge since last week but my left nipple looks completely chapped, like you could peel the top off. I had put some lotion on it but you can still feel how dry it feels. So, I am at a loss. Does discharge have to be more continuous in order to be of major concern or is bloody discharge no matter what an issue? I am TERRIFIED of this being cancer. My dad just died of lung, bone and non-hodgkins a few months ago. Having this other health issue making cancer a possible chance doesn't make me feel better either. Oh...and I have had some awful pain along the outer edge of this same breast for almost 10 months ago (which they have said is nothing...but hurts to the slightest touch!). What could that be from? I outruled my underwire bras this past summer by not wearing one for over a month and it didn't make any difference. I am just scared. My husband is having a hard time because his mother had breast cancer, which was the start to many others.

I first noticed a few weird palpitations about two years ago. It feels like a single hiccup or jumpstart or skipped beat in the heart area and it usually makes me cough, although I don't feel like I have to cough (not a lung thing). Frequency was once or twice a week. This lasted for about a year until I started noticing it happening more often and I started to notice my heartbeat pounding loudly at times where it shouldn't. I went to see my family doctor. He listened to my heartbeat and told me that he could hear a very minor abnormality in the electrical rhythm. He ordered a cardiogram and Holter monitor test. During my wait for the Holter monitor setup appointment, I began experiencing increased palpitations, and one night, noticeable chest pains that got me worried. I ended up going to the ER for which they did an EKG and again, found nothing abnormal. I did the 24-hour Holter test and saw a cardiologist, whom proceeded to tell me he couldn't find anything of note in the Holter results and that it was likely due to diet or caffeine intake or stress . My stats: I'm 25 years old, 5 10 and a muscly 200 pounds. Yes, I could stand to lose a few pounds! However, for years, I have been regularly exercising at least three times a week, if not more. I play ice-hockey twice a week, swim, run, lift etc. Which brings me to my next issue. Increasingly as of the last few months (this is about 9 months since the Holter test), when I play hockey, during the first half of the game or so, when I come back to the bench after a shift, I will have several very noticeable heart-hiccups (that's what I call them) on the bench, probably about 6 or 7 of them. As soon as I get back on the ice for the next shift, they go away. It seems to be only when I go from high-heart-rate back down to something reasonable while I am sitting. About halfway through the game, once I've been playing for a good half our or so, they don't happen as much or at all. It's getting to a point where I am CONVINCED that something is wrong with my heart... yet all of the EKGs etc have yielded nothing from the doctors. This of course makes me hesitant to go back and see the doc again. Another symptom... occasionally I will feel feint but noticeable pains in my chest. I decided to take my pulse during one of these incidents and noticed my heart rate was about 54-55. I've read it should be above 60. Anyone with any ideas as to what's going on with the ticker?

I wished her well and hoped for the best not only for her but for myself because once again in my life I've had to change people to talk to for the umpteenth time! Unfortunately, I have found that they pretty much give you anyone who might have space on their appointment book and not look at perhaps how old you are or what your life experience has been to match you up with someone who remembers things back in the day and can make you feel comfortable speaking to them so that the healing can begin or continue. I am trying to find someone who is closer to my own age and not someone who will just speak to you clinically and nitpick. Is anyone else experiencing this dilemma? I have been in counseling for many years and I can honestly say that I have been through 8 or 9 counselors since the year 2000! Granted, I have been seen at two different clinics and have purposely changed in the past 3 years because I don't need counselors who want me to wear their i-pods to listen to music that only they like, or the ones that act like your mother and tell you every move to make now that your over 50, or begin to fall asleep in the middle of a session!

I finally went to the ENT today, but before I tell you about that.. Let me go back a month. Last month, I couldn't take the pain in my head or the back of my neck anymore. It hurt behind my eyes when I coughed, I had the sinus headaches.. and the left lymph node at the base of my neck keeps swelling up and down.. and on worse days, it would affect the lymph node in my (front) neck, making my throat hurt.. So, I go to my doc (regular doc) and they give me Augmentin for a week.. I take it. Every single time, about an hour after I take it, I can feel it, as the lymph node at the back of my neck starts to pulse/burn.. but that is about it.. 5 days into the augmentin, I 1st research up an ENT and make an appt with them for today.. as they were on vacation at the time.. But, I didn't shop around, for this ENT would have instant access to my cat scan that I had done in Oct. and then 2nd call up my doc and tell her that the augmentin isn't working.. My head is still killing me, and my neck still hurt. She basically tells me to just finish taking the meds, keep my appt with the ENT (in the same hospital) and perhaps it will just go away on it's own !! So.. I've been suffering for the past month (as it was Apr 13 when I made the calls).. Okay. So now. I go to the ENT today.. He has my cat scan, and then proceeds to tell me (very informative, nice, etc.. ) That whatever I am experiencing, is NOT being caused by my sinus's. I don't even have any remnants showing that I've been having sinus infections.. He shows me my cat scan, and tells me that there are people out there that would KILL to have my sinus's.. They are THAT clean.. That yes, I do have a slightly deviated septum, but that it is not hindering my airflo what-so-ever and showed me where it was on the charts.. I mean.. I guess that my sinus's are so good, that he didn't even think that I smoked.. (I do) Anyway.. going by his suggestions.. I now have to go 1. to the allergist and be allergy tested. and then if those come out negative I then have to schedule with a Neurologist.. So.. Does anyone have any experiences of this? Having the pressure behind the eyes, having your head hurt when you cough, apparent sinus headaches, and swollen lymph nodes? But aren't being caused by your sinus's? Sorry it's so long.. but.

For the most part my depression has been fairly mild, though it spikes when I'm stressed, as I am now. Recently I've felt that I'm wasting away, headed toward both mental, and legal, issues. I live with my parents, both nearly fifty, and they care, a lot, and provide for me quite well, despite one being unemployed, due to a nagging injury. I did not graduate from high school, as a result of a vocal tic that aided what a doctor best described as school refusal. I intend to get a GED next year, and only intend to do so because there is mounting pressure from my family and a close friend. I don't meet people. I don't have friends in the area, that I actually go out to see. In this situation, I'm actually friends with former classmates on Facebook, yet I avoid them in-person.I've all but vanished from the real world, and instead immerse myself in music, games, books, and movies. Twenty hours or so of each day are spent inside my room, most of that either lying in bed or sitting at my desk. I want to change this, but hit a hard block every time I get close to kicking out of the routine, and find myself back at my desk, talking to people miles away from me, feeling normal, instead of angry and worthless. If your only interaction with me was online, you might think nothing at all was wrong with me, aside from a cynical attitude toward life in general.That said, in addition to my normal problems detailed above, I have been receiving SSI payments since last year. I keep a tight leash on my spending for anything that isn't absolutely necessary. I voluntarily contribute to the house bills, and recently got a $40 monthly wireless internet connection for the family, both to help my parents with their browsing and media viewing, and myself with my online gaming habits.(Shooters and strategy games, no MMOs.) This month has taken a horrible turn, though.Not even a week ago, my cat became impacted, and had to be cared for at both an emergency clinic, and the veterinarian. My father took care of the vet visit, and I took care of the clinic visit. In addition, I paid for the dog's yearly checkup, as there was a sale of sorts at the veterinary clinic. I get roughly $450 a month, the cat's bill was $150, the internet bill was $40, and the dog's bill might be either $70 or $90. If it is the latter, I may be in some trouble. As I mentioned, my gaming habits have a hold on me. You'll notice that it's not even been a week since the month started. Already my balance is down to $111. I have paid the internet and cat bills already. With the last bill for the month, I will have either $40 or $20 left. My only commitment to the home and pets is to get them food, and in my dog's case, healthcare products. He lives in the yard outside, and we worry much more about his health than the cat's, as dumb as it might seem.The main issue here is, if I'm left with twenty dollars for food and care products for my pets, I'll have to inform my parents that I have no money left. In addition, basic mathematics make it clear that I have overspent by a country mile on non-essentials this month. I looked at the balance today, and upon seeing $131, I came to the downright stupid conclusion that I could get away with one more game, and brought it down to $111. Now I feel sick, ashamed, and downright pathetic, for giving in to impulse, and possibly paving the way for my parents to have to contribute even more money to my pets and their well-being. I'm not particularly upset with myself to a dangerous level, just...disappointed. That's the worst kind of emotion I can have for myself. This isn't even worthy of wanting to kick myself in the rear. This is downright immoral, on my part.

My blood pressure was elevated 140/88, (Not nearly has high as it had been several weeks ago) and he is considering puting me on blood presssure meds...wants me to monitor it for a few weeks. He didn't seem too worried about my heart and didn't think I needed any more tests. I came home releived thinking it probably was stress. Yesterday I took a short bike ride and when I came home my throat had that strange feeling again like I had something stuck or that I needed to burp ....It lasted all night and I still feel it a little this morning.

For about two years now I've have been experiencing chest pains (mostly on my left side). But I would also notice at times I would have a very irregular heart beat. It would tend to slow up and then speed up rapidly. I played football two summers ago and it would happen mostly when I was practice but other times it would happen if I would just be laying on my bed.

Later on that week my mom had scheduled a stress test and when to my local hospital to get tested. They straped those things my chest and ran the test. The doctors said tht I was in good shape and they saw nothing wrong with my heart when it was running on the trendmill. Then this past year in March my chest pains started to return so this time I decided to get an EKG ran on me. The doctors said my results came out okay and that the pain could have been cause by lift weights too much. But I thought tht if that was the case wouldn't it be on my right side too? I dunno, so anyways he gave me a prescription medicine and I went about my business. But recently (this week) the pains have been getting worse on my left side, one time I was almost to the point were I had to grab my chest while I was working outside because the pain would be pretty noticable.

Since I got here I got on and off fluoxedine due to some episodes of mild depression, which mainly affected my sleep (with early awakening) and marginally lowered my mood and for which I also did some talk therapy. Recently, I found out that my seasonal condition is called seasonal affective disorder, so I have withdrawn antidepressants and jumped on bright light therapy, which stabilized both mood and sleep. So far so good, the problem is that this jumping on and off antidepressants over the years induced a decrease in libido and partial erectile dysfunction. Hormone levels have been tested and are normal, so I suspect it may have sth to do with serotonin levels. I read high levels of serotonin induce these issues just like the side effects of SSRIs antidepressants, so the questions I have are these: 1)I have suspended SSRIs 2 months ago, why I still have these side effects? 2)Also, eventually the only way to reduce serotonin levels seems to be via Periactin, is it worth for me to try? 3)Which specialist would know best anout this field, an endocrinolgyst, a neurologist or a psychiatrist? My doctor wants to refer me to an endocrinogist, is this the best solution? 4)I read that low serotonin (eg depression) ia accompanied by decrease in libido, but also high levels of serotonin (eg use of SSRIs antidepressants) bring low sex drive, so shall I assume that only at mid levels of serotonin my sex dive will work just fine? 5) Shall i suspend the bright light therapy as this increases my serotonin levels? 6) Shall i suspend doing sport as it increases the production of serotonin too?

447472258,"What is the cause of symptoms, conditions, or test findings X?",No,,722916,Could it still be my heart," A little background on me first, I am 27 years old, overweight by about 210 pounds, high blood pressure since I was 13, high cholesterol, asthma, polycystic ovarian syndrome, osteoarthritis, and chronic anxiety disorder plus I am a smoker. OK so here is the issue. Back in may I went to the ER because I was having stabbing, burning pain in the left side of my chest about level with the armpit, the pain radiated into my shoulder, ribs, and upper abdomen. Very sporadic, never constant for more than 30 seconds or so. Pressure feeling in the center of my chest around where the sternum is and a little above and below. No sweats, crushing pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. I had an EKG, cardiac enzymes, ultrasound of my heart, CT scan of heart and lungs, blood pressure was 146/89, pulse was normal, and all tests came back normal. They gave me morphine for pain, a breathing treatment and sent me home. After about a week the pain was gone then in August it started again. Went to my doc and they did chest xray and ekg both normal. Doc said it was caused from GERD put me on Nexium. Chronic heartburn gone but pain is still here. They keep telling me it isn't my heart or lungs causing it. Nothing makes it worse usually when having the pain if I sit straight up stretch my arms up over my head it goes away quickly. I do not know what to do these doctors are playing off to be nothing but I am really starting to worry. Also the left side and center of my chest hurts when pressed on. I take my pulse constantly throughout the day usually stays between 68 to 80, no shortness of breath, pain never spreads anywhere but localized area. The pain seems to get worse after physical activity not before or during, but it is more of a muscular pain than heart. I also notice that after I eat or drink it gets worse or not take my medicine. I am on Lisinopril, Lovastatin, Proventil HFA, Nexium, Advair Diskus, Zyrtec, and Singulair. Could it still be my heart although all tests are normal and there are no signs of having or ever had a heart attack?",65,0.361538104

I am a 15 year old girl, in England, and I think I have something wrong with me. I have been shy all my life, and I never had very many friends. When I did have friends, they acted like they didn't want to be friends with me and used me a bit.... When I started secandery school, everything got worse, I dind it is getting harder and harder to talk, and Im becoming more and more depressed. I'm scared of the phone, I absolutley terrified of going shopping, which is really strange for girls my age. Whenever I try to talk to someone, because I really do want friends, my brains goes panicky of what they'll think of me, and I feel really sick and nervous. And when we have to speak in front of the class or something, my breathing goes really rapid, and I feel even more sick. It's weird, but whenever my mum feels sad or tired I always feel really guilty, and hate myself like its my fault. I sort of know that it isn't but still, it makes me realy hate myself. And when i cant bring myself to say something I need to say, I hate myself more. Last october, around the time my Gran died, maybe a bit before, I tried to kill myself. And I am really worried that whoever is reading this will think that it is because I want attention or that I think its a cool 'trend' or something. D: But I seriously did not want to live anymore, I still don't but, I'm such a coward. I used a razor on my wrists, as this was the only way I could do it. If I had a gun I probably would have done it by now. I did cut quite hard and it did bleed alot, but I didn't die. I'm too much of a coward to do it hard enough. Although; I know it is very cowardly and selfish to commit suide anyway. But I am cowardly and selfish, and its just so hard to keep living. There is no point.

Additional views needed on clustered microcalcifications but doctor said they appeared benign in appearance and to come back in 1 year. This year, same thing... same microcalcifications viewed but different radiologist said they were so tiny, small, fuzzy, and can't tell... labeled them indeterminent and BiRad4 biopsy recommended...although his suspicions were low of cancer. Nothing changed from year ago... his opinion he said was just different. I had an attempted stereotactic 2 months ago but didn't work. Dense breasts, small breasts, calcifications are so hard to find. The next recommendation was excisional surgery biopsy. Met with surgeon. She suggested 6 month follow up? I said but radiologist suggested biopsy?! She asked if they could attempt another stereotactic to avoid surgery. I agreed. That stereotactic biopsy was today. Again, didn't take. Upon many twists/turns/squeezes... they couldn't find the microcalcifications on image because breasts are so small and dense. The only time you can really see them is during a regular diagnostic imaging mammogram. Radiologist suggested 6 month follow-up as she wasn't highly suspicious. But she did say if I wanted to see this through to the end, I would need surgery. I'm 38 years old. No breast cancer history. Yet every grandparent I have has died of another type of cancer. I need a couple days to think about what to do next. This is so hard. On the one hand their suspisions are low. But, they have seen this kind of thing turn up as cancer... at some times. There just isn't a guarantee. Every radiologist/dr I talk to says something different. First radiologist said 80% of biopsied calcifications turn up benign. Today this radiolgist said 90%.

Last time I posted here was about month ago...I was freaking....since then I've done a complete 180. Got put on Lexapro, because my anxiety was through the roof. It has helped tremendously. I was also on klonopin, but only had to take that several times..don't even need that anymore. Go Thursday for results of surgical biopsy. While I was in recovery room, surgeon spoke with hubby and said everything went very well....and he was very confident results would be good. I am not very anxious about Thursday. I've even chosen to go alone. Even IF it is DCIS, I know I can abosultely handle that. I have the best support, family and friends.

For many many years, I've been taking Allegra D at night time to help control my snoring. It also helps me breathe better for deeper sleep. For a while, I was taking it twice daily to clear up my sinuses. However - one paticular day - I got really dizzy chills. I blamed it on *missing a dose* of the allegra. After this episode, I stopped taking it twice a day. Since then, I was taking the allegra continuously once daily at night before I got to bed. I've had other issues pop up. I had ear surgery and my ears/sinuses are clogged up enough that I still can't hear much outta my one ear (unless it POPS open). So - the doctors tell me its all allergies and sinuses and suggested I go back onto Allegra twice daily to help clear up my ear/sinues. Currently, I'm taking Singulair once daily and Allegra D twice daily again - have been for about 6 months. It was several hours that the original dose wore off - but I got a nasty episode of dizziness nausea again - with weird eye movements. This has been my 2nd episode in YEARS of taking this stuff.

I am currently on Nadolol, and it was working magically for about two years. As of 2 months ago I was on 20mg daily, but it started to feel like too high a dose (sluggishness, bradycardia, etc). I have specific instructions from my cardiologist to adjust my own dose between 10mg-40mg daily, as my condition fluctuates. So I went down to 10mg daily for about a week, but that was too low. I went back up to 20mg right when I got a new prescription refill at a different pharmacy than usual, and all of a sudden the medication doesn't seem to work at all anymore. Historically the tachycardia has been purely exercise-induced, with no symptoms whatsoever at rest. Now I have a rapid heartbeat ALL the time, some days far worse than others. I am constantly dizzy because of it. I am taking 40mg daily of the Nadolol (at the cardio doc's recommendation... he seemed unconcerned about the change), but it does not seem to help. I thought maybe it was the new refill, but I got a different one and that doesn't work either. Has anyone else ever had beta blockers spontaneously give up on them like this? Not only that, but has anyone else ever had sinus tachycardia turn so drastically downhill spontaneously?

Be careful not to smack your forehead when turning corners...). After two irrigations with this funny crooked run thing, I was fine again. I CAN'T believe it took me days to figure this out!! Anyway, I know there are a few people who were not having great results with irrigating and I thought maybe this would help them. Also, I know some people use Afrin to make the swelling go away, then the irrigating works. I don't recommend or use Afrin myself, but I would think that if you use it for a bit and get yourself all cleaned out maybe you wouldn't need the Afrin for long?? Whatever works for ya!! Anyhoo..good luck all! Nat",10,0.595964049

Over 4 million Americans have CHF, resulting in 870,000 hospitalizations and 260,000 deaths per year. In clinical trials, carvedilol reduced all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, sudden death, and death due to progressive heart failure in patients with heart failure. In addition, favorable effects on the remodeling process in heart failure were seen, with a decrease in left ventricular size and improvement in ejection fraction. Forty-six patients completed a 12 month followup after a clinical trial. Results: Left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 26% � 8% at baseline to 39% � 14% at 12 months. New York Heart Association class improved from 2.3 � 0.4 at baseline to 1.8 � 0.7 at 12 months. Brain natriuretic peptide fell from 453 � 784 to 208 � 393 pg/mL at 6 months and 223 � 334 pg/mL at 12 months. N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide did not change between baseline and 6 months but fell at 12 months (2117 � 1678, 2015 � 1532, and 1438 � 1442 pg/mL, respectively). Angiotensin II was lower at 6 and 12 months than at baseline (12.6 � 10, 7.8 � 5.5 pg/mL). Left ventricular ejection fraction at 12 months correlated inversely with BNP level at 12 months. It should be obvious why someone like me with Congestive Heart Failure would LOVE Coreg! And...... Coreg (Carvedilol) is a generic at merely $10 for a three months supply! :D Why would any cardiologist not, at least, consider Coreg as his first line of treatment for Heart Failure? :confused: A very important note: Medicines, even those as great as Coreg, will not be as effective as they could be, if the metabolism is unhealthy or unbalanced.

Since then I have been prodding and poking all over my chest, armpit, breast areas. I have suffered to episodes of extreme discomfort on the right side where the pea-sized lump is located (both coming oddly around the time of my menstrual cycle). During these episodes my shoulder feel so tense and painful, I would wake up with my arm hurting as well. There has also been a deep chest pain (note: around this time my dog stepped on that exact chest area as I was laying down) and at times it feels like I have a weird lump in my throat feeling. I know this could very well be attributed to stress and anxiety.

The team that did the surgery made me feel so comfortable I never worried for a second. It took 3 1/2 hours. My doctor was awesome and has been doing these since they started doing them. I had a diagnosis of AVNRT and that was what they found. They said the surgery went well, very routine. The worst part was I had some definite uncomfortableness throughout my chest and during the procedure I questioned the nurse and she said it was normal and not to worry. The cathetor stuff didn't bother me and I don't even know I have the wounds. I do remember my heart racing like crazy (but hey what else is new, but I kept thinking that hopefully it would be for the last time ever so I didn't care about it). The worst part was staying still for 11 hours I was in so much pain from that I was starting to freakout the last 3 hours even though I kept telling myself it was almost over. When I stood up the pain was awful so I decided to sleep it off and I did and woke up feeling perfect!! PLEASE do the surgery. It's ONE day.

I know I have good things in my life but put so much focus on what I don't have. I have great family and friends. I have a stable career. I have my health. Yet I feel alone pretty much most of the time. I've never had a long term relationship and still have my virginity. There was one person that I dated for about 2 months, 5 years ago, who I still think about everyday. Pathetic!! I'm on Match.com. I want to put myself out there so badly but stay in my shell. I sign on everyday thinking maybe that day will be the day that I give it a go. I either contact those who don't return the favor or get contacted by those that don't interest me. I find myself believing that I'm destined to spend my life alone. I don't want to live my life alone. There has to be someone who will understand me and my virginity. I let that hold be back in fear of rejection. I know I won't get anywhere if I continue to do that. It's so hard watching others live their lives. I can't live another 30 years like this.

So I decided in order to really save money, I'll be moving home for a few months. I have a great relationship with my parents but it will be an adjustment.

Input needed please.," First off this is gonna be a long story, so if you have the time PLEASE keep reading. I could really use some imput here. Im a 20 year old female with asthma. Two years ago I started having chest pain,chest pressure,irragular beats that you could feel by pressing you hand to my side even, dizzyness, short of breath, light headed, blurry vision, face flushing then paleing and all around fatiuge. I went to my local hospital after one episode that lasted for more then 24 hours but at 18 no doctor seemed to believe anything could be wrong with my heart. this kept happening and every ER doctor I saw and my GP all told me it had to be the caffiene i drank or not enough sleep or not enough water. All things i had taken care of after the first visit. i cut out my caffiene intake, i drank more water and got my 8 hours but nothing was helping. after a year of fighting with doctors to HELP me not just roll their eyes and say i was too young i finially got my GP to refer me to a cardiologist. About november last year i met with him and i was completely dishearted to find that the first thing he said to me was your far to young to be in here seeing me. WHAT is WITH that? I was being treated like i was crazy just because i am younger then i guess normal . But it had taken me so long to get to a specialist and as much as i wanted to walk out and say forget it I stayed. First visit i was sent home with the orders to stop caffinie (which i insisted i did not drink anything caffinated and at this point i had even cut out chocolate) and to drink more water and see him in a few weeks. Flusterated almost to the point of tears, i did as i was told and came back two weeks later. Second Visit: I reported no change in symptoms and AGAIN said i didnt not take in any caffine and drank even more water. With a SIGH ( really this DR treated me like i was a pest not a paitient) he ordered a month holster monitor. I completed that and the start of january went in for another appointment and my monitor results. He reported that I had at two seprate times hit both bradycardia and techycardia was well as had an irrigular heartbeat at times, but he was not worried because i was so young. At this point i lost it. As embarassing as it is to admit I started crying. i was so fed up with being in pain and fatiuged for so long and no one seemed to want to help or even believe me. i think out of pity he said he'd set up two more tests. I did the Stress ECHO no problem, im pretty fit aside from this issue and asthma. the first echo did show that one of my valves did have slightly more then normal back flow? but again, they said i was young and didnt have anything to worry about with that. i did the stress part (running) no issue aside from being short of breathe and light headed. The next and final test was a Tilt-table test. Just like all the others the operator commented on my age. But at the 5 miniute mark I was pale, very low bp and heart rate, sweating and feeling like i was gonna be sick. clearly a positive result. I went back to my cardilogist in Febuary I was diagnosed with Neurocardiogenic Syncope. I was put on atenolol 25 mg and told to come back at the end of my script. for a follow up. He told me too that this is a common thing for young adult women to have and that id grown out of it . he said we was expecting me to not need the beta blockers in just a few months and sent me on my way. Now im at the end of my script. and for the past few weeks even though im taking my meds. as perscribed i still some times experance what I did before. and if i forget a dose? im in pain weak and everything like before after just ONE missed dose. Ive NEVER fainted only came close once when i was at the tilt table test. The beta blockers are not working as well as they where before. IT is also notable that heart diease and everything other heart condition runs ramped through my mothers side of the family and many members of my dads side have heart problems as well. most noteable is all my my grand parents have heart health issues. SO my question to anyone who is still reading is this. Is it your thought that this really is NCS? or do you ( like me) kind of think he just threw me on beta blockers to shut me up? If its not NCS what could it be? And how do I get these doctors to see me as someone who needs help and not as a too young child who needs a bandaid?

I have the fibro/myofacial, tmj (that's where the disc(s) in your jaw are messed up - mine is flattened. A lot of people with fibro eventually get tmj. My tmj doc feels that it can affect you nasally (congestion). The cfids - is chronic fatigue immune deficiency - a lot of people with cfids have many allergies - along with fibro. I see the allergist next month and will probably have another skin test to compare to the blood test done recently. The allergist I had said I had no food allergies. But the bloodwork shows an allergy to 30 different foods! I am also being treated for hypothyroid and adrenal dysfunction so it's really hard to tell what is truly causing the nasal congestion. Did your doc give you anything for the nasal fungus? If he only gave you an antibiotic, that won't kill the fungus from what I've read. You have to be treated with an antifungal medicine, nasally or oral. I have just started doing a sinus cleanse and it is coming out clear. It helps sooth the membranes, but doesn't help it from still getting very dry. Have you tried that? I also have read that if you see black in the mucous that that is a sign of fungus too.

We switched allergists and, therefore, serums. After we switched the serums she deteriorated. She was supposed to move to once per month shots and we were back to every two weeks. Well, after a year of this I switched her back to the original allergist. She is even worse now! She is now back on antihistamines! Do you think that switching serums messes up everything?

I have had chronic sinus/sore throat/cough problems for quite some time. Found mold in the basement and attic which is supposed to be remediated but the remediator has been VERY slow in responding. We even have chaetomium in the basement which I never heard of but seems to be as bad as stachy. I also have been sick since last March - hyperthyroidism, have had a mastectomy, severe osteoporosis, Crohn's disease, acid reflux and have not done as much cleaning as one should. I decided to do some testing on my own as the inspector charged $1,700 for testing and didn't come up with all he should have. He missed a large spot in the basement that I found after. My bedroom has millions of live Penicillium spores -no visable mold. The Lab director actually called me with his concerns. Also, the living room has heavy aspergillus/penicillium. My husband only makes $16/hour and said no more testing - what you can't see can't hurt you. Perhaps I am reading too much on the internet but I am scared. He sleeps in the other room which has regular house mold (rare) because of his terrible snoring so I am left to sleep in the condemned room. I bought a couple of air purifiers and put one in my room. Since I cannot test anymore I guess I have to hope for the best. He thinks it is coming from an old dresser that has kids toys in it and the drawers don't fit quite right from the grandkids climbing on them. The toys have not been touched for about a year. However, the Lab Director said they are live viable spores that can only be if it is damp or humid. The humidity in the room has been around 42% to 45% and I give up. Meanwhile, how do we get the dresser out without spreading the spores around? Hubby wants to take it out tomorrow night as Thursday is garbage day and empty out the drawers outside. I spoke to the inspector and he said if it is disturbed (cleaned any more or moved) spores will be dispersed in the bedroom, hallway, down the stairs and out the door. I wonder if I can somehow wrap it in plastic and just leave the legs sticking out and clean them with moldzyme. Any one have any thoughts on this???? I don't think the dresser is the cause, just part of the problem. It is so cold also and I am run down and sick now from all the cleaning and not sleeping well and I cringe thinking about going out there in the dark, cleaning out drawers. Guess I'll need another shower and maybe if I wear 3 hooded sweatshirts I don't have to spend money at the cleaners for my coat. Thanks for any suggestions. Suggi",10,0.917922638
447489506,"Story telling, news, sharing or asking about experience, or soliciting support.",No,,149912,A protocol," After fighting chronic bacterial sinusitis for months, seeing a lot of doctors (allergists, ENT, GP, etc.) I've developed a method for dealing with symptoms which I think offers some relief. There are 2 parts to this. PART ONE: When you have symptoms of a bacterial infection in the sinuses. These include facial/forehead pain, frequent headaches, yellow or green nasal discharge, dizziness/lightheadedness, cloudy vision, and stuffed up sinuses. 1. Antibiotics: either Avelox or Levaquin for a MINIMUM of 14 days. 21 is even better if your doctor allows it. 2. Prednisone: go on this for 4-5 days, and remember to taper off. This reduces inflamation and allows the antibiotic to penetrate the sinuses. 3. Nasal steroids: Nasacort or Rhinocort PART TWO: if you have chronic sinus problems even when bacteria may not be present, such as nasal blockage, swelling, allergic shiners, etc. 1. Irrigation: Use either a machine (I use a Grossan Hydropulse, but there are others), or a spray bottle. Do this twice daily, once in the morning when you wake up, and once at night. The solution that works for me is: a) 20ml of Alkalol (you can order this from your drug store) b) 480ml of warm water (not hot) c) a pinch of sea salt d) a pinch of baking soda 2. Mucinix: a mucus thinner. Take 2 tablets twice a day. You can get this from the pharmacy, but you have to ask. 3. Antihistamine spray: Astelin is a good one. 4. Drink TONS of water. 5. Get 8 hours sleep minimum. The less sleep I get, the worse my sinuses feel. 6. Use humidifiers in the bedroom. 7. A Steam mask : I use one from Conair. It basically blows steam into your face, and helps soothe the sinuses. This works well in winter. 8. Hot baths. --------------------------------------------------------- Now what NOT to do! 1. Do NOT take OTC antihistamines while you have a bacterial infection. You will make it even worse. 2. Do NOT use decongestant sprays. You will have a rebound effect later. 3. Do NOT go on antibiotics for less than 14 days. The bacteria will become antibiotic resistant.",10,0.224015645

In the past years I've had a number of problems like arrhythmia, tachycardia, needle pinch-like pain in the heart area, knife-like pain in the heart area when under stress or laughing hard... etc. Currently the problems are lower, but the thing is that I've been to a pulmonary/lung exam x-ray yesterday and my lungs-specialist asked me: do you have problems wiht your heart? - I got shocked and asked her how did you guess, what do you see on the x-ray ... She said she is not sure, but there might be some sort of an artery lengthening above the heart or something... she avoided saying anything, but sure scared the hedgehogs out of me! Important details about my past heart problems... - I was under tremendous stress druing my early 20s, was often the victim of verbal abuse in the family, during fights I often felt arrhythmia - I had a period when following a family scandal I started feeling a strong needle pinch-like pain in the heart whenever I made a little effort: sat down, got up, laughed, walked up or down stairs... I could not do anything, felt like someone was stabbing me... lasted 2-3 months, then got cured because the family doctor gave me metoprolol - family doctor said I had tachycardia, told me I have a vary fast pulse and asked me are you under stress? sure I was for many years!... sent me to EKG, but no problem was found... - went 2 times to electrocardiogramm/EKG examinations in my life, but they said it was OK - I never felt the brutal needle-pinch-like stabbing in the heart after the metoprolol treatment, but I still have irregular heartbeats, like the heart sometimes doesn't beat or beats faster or slower... - only sometimes I get so stressed I see darker with my eyes, like my head is exploding... perhaps because of brutal conflicts I always hear between my parents... - sometimes after jogging I have bluish/dark rings around my eyes and my eyes seem to swell a bit, but not very much... though noticeable, people stare at me on the streets like I was some sort of a Bettlejuice or something :eek: I sometimes lift small weights and do running (not on a daily basis), only about 20 min/occasion... about 2 times/week.

Nothing unusual as though I don't drink tea or coffee, I do drink energy drinks and have taken these pills before. However about 20 mins later my heart started pounding, I got really hot and dizzy, and struggled to breathe - in short, I suffered an anxiety attack for the first time in my life. It freaked the hell out of me. After about an hour my heart was still racing so I went to a local free-clinic to get myself checked. The nurses there took my blood pressure, did an ECG test, listened to my heart and did a blood-sugar test as well. When I first arrived my heart was at129bpm despite my sitting prefectly still. My oxygen levels, blood pressure and sugar level were fine though and as my pulse gradually calmed down during the 40 mins or so I spent with them, in the end they sent me on my way and said to take it easy and rest up. I thought that would be it, but since then I've experienced frequent symptoms that are starting to concern me. Most days at some point or other I've experienced some brief palpatations and dizziness that passes after a minute or two. More annoyingly is that on a few occasions over the last two weeks I've had a really sharp sudden pain in the right side of my chest, with tightness making it hard and painful to breathe (it is what I would imagine a collapsed lung to feel like). Again though, after 5-10 mins this has passed too. Otherwise in general I've felt quite tired, despite it being a fairly relaxed Christmas. I'm 28 and in good health (I think). I'm not exactly a couch potato and according to my Wii Fit I'm a bit underweight. Basically what I'm asking is should I go and see my GP and tell them all this?

Apparently there was a high amount still showing in my system. They explained that at the lab, they dilute the sample and test, then dilute again and test.

My doctor rarely does follow ups unless I ask for them. I have been asking to wean off of them because I feel as though they arent the proper route for me. I am also on Wellbutrin. So my doctor switched my rx to the minimal dosage. I take 37.5 mg once a day. I have been trying to cut that one out, but OMG the side effects are unbearable... My doc has told me to open the caplet and count out the granules and take one granule away per day... Has anyone does this with any success?? I am being tested for all sort of things, since I feel awful, pain in the body, loss of hair, no emotion, no libido, constantly tired etc.. So far it looks like my thryroid..but after some research I am starting to think that my problem is related to the Effexor? Could this be possible? Any input would be greatly appreciated!

It's on my left breast, and looks like a little horizontal line near my armpit. I haven't been able to feel a lump, but maybe I just haven't checked carefully enough? I'm due for my annual mammogram, so I'm going to call and set it up and mention that although it's a routine mammogram, I do have a concern - maybe they'll get me in sooner. I'm trying not to panic. Meanwhile, is there any way that this could be within the realm of normal? I do have fibrocystic breasts that always get a little swollen and lumpy looking during my period, so I'll worry less if it's gone in a few days.

During my last annual GYN exam (4/11), the doctor mentioned that I had fibroids on both sides of my uterus. She just mentioned that they were there and didn't say anything else about them. My periods are very irregular and only last about a day or two when I do get them. The last one I had was in early April and it was heavier than usual and MUCH more painful. It is now late May and I have not had a period, which is not unusual. Yesterday I noticed some watery, light pink discharge on the toilet paper. I haven't seen anything like this before...it's definitely not like a period. I used a minipad and throughout the day it was just this really light pink, watery stuff. I took a nap and when I got up I noticed on the toilet paper a heavier, slightly darker discharge, but still not what I would call a period. The same thing happened this morning when I woke up, but there hasn't been much more today. I have had horrible heartburn for the past few days (I do have a hiatal hernia, but my heartburn has been well controlled) and my whole abdomen just feels full and bloated. Also, for the past several weeks I've noticed that when I urinate I feel a dull, ache type pain in my vagina. Boy...I must sound like quite a mess! I'm just wondering if any of this is common for others who are taking Tamoxifen. I know uterine changes are a side effect with Tamoxifen, but I'm just not sure if what I'm experiencing are normal side effects or something I should be more concerned about. Thanks for your help!

However, when I was at my worst I had to take heart medication (atenolol) and was hospitalized on the telemetry unit for a week at one point b/c of irregular EKG's and very low body weight. So starting yesterday I felt a sharp pain on my left side and although it hurt to breathe, I wasn't out of breath or anything. Also, at that time this started I was just sitting on my couch watching the news and catching up on things online. It was at night so I just decided to go to bed. I woke up this morning and felt fine but then a couple of hours after waking the pain started up again. This time it was when I while I was sitting in a certification class I'm taking right now. As a side note, I also take Parnate (an MAOI) and there's a long list of things that I cannot eat due to causing heart problems. I'm very good about my diet as far as that goes so I don't think it's related to the Parnate. I have some anxiety issues but they never cause chest pain and when these recent incidents occured I was not anxious at all. And, when I'm not anxious, my blood pressure typically runs pretty low... I'm not sure what to do -- I don't want to make a big deal out of nothing but at the same time I've never felt pain like this in this area. Any thoughts on what to do or what could be causing this?

I have these thoughts going round in my head and find myself within minutes of waking up checking to see if theyre still there, which just brings it on.

I was on 3 different antibiotics and finally got a CT sinus scan that was all clear. I saw a new doc last week who told me my ears are completely clogged (eustachian tube dysfunction) and he said I defintely have rhinitis probably to ragweed. I have intense pressure under my eyes and get trigger headaches when the pressure feeling gets bad. My head CT was also normal. I had similar symptoms last year until the weather cooled off, from about the end of July to mid Sept (I am in Colorado). My ears are stuffed and the sinus pressure is there even though my sinuses are clear. Does anyone else get facial pressure and headaches that go along with the allergy. My nose really doesn't run but I am majorly stuffed up. I started Flonase three weeks ago and take tylenol and benadryl, I am miserable...can anyone relate??? I have a severe allergy to almonds,sulfa meds and cepholosporin antibitoics but haven't seen an allergist to test beyond this but get to see one in a week.

His recent psychiatrist has basically given up on him. It is hereditary in my family, I went thru it in 1986 but fortunately received the right medication that I still take and have never suffered thru depression again since that time. What I have found is that most psychiatrists work on a trial and error basis when trying to find the right medication which unless you're in a private clinic can take a very long long time being treated as an outpatient. The fact is unless you've have truly suffered the hell of depression then you do not understand or have a clue what the sufferer is going thru. What I am seeking is a psychiatrist in NJ that has gone thru depression and understands the real feelings of the patient and is able to communicate in a way that the patient understands.

I went to see my doctor they checked for anemia..negative and now they are testing my electrolytes. Ive heard some allergies can cause this. i also wanna say back in march i had a bad cold. my face was a bit swollen and ever since then ive been congested. especially in the mornings. i never had any allergys before so i didnt think i would now. i was looking up on allergys and most thing is itchy eyes but i dont have that (not very often) but i also wear contacts so i wouldnt think i would. i know when i peel onions my eyes dont water because my contacts are covering them. my dizziness has not worsened and it doesnt get worse by any activity besides moving my eyes around too fast. i know that some dizziness is caused by lack of oxygen but im a smoker (trying to quit) and i would think if this was a oxygen problem it would worsen when i smoked and it doesnt. i was also worried about heart trouble. i had an ekg and chest xray 3 weeks ago and all was normal. but when i told the doctor this he said no further testing would need done and i told him the dizziness came AFTER all those heart tests and he said its not cardiac related. i had an eye exam on thursday thinking it was my eyes and there was nothing abnormal but i did get a new prescription. Doctor said i do have significant TMJ disorder on my left side dont know if theres a connection there or not but since that bad cold in march i have had a itchy throat (on and off) funny taste in mouth in morning and congestion. little afraid to be taking sudafed because i was suffering from a fast pulse rate as well ( i probable would not of noticed it if i wasnt looking for it so maybe anxiety related due to the dizziness) when i feel dizzy i get scared so im sure thats why pulse went up. i started taking a beta blocker just to calm myself so i didnt have to feel my heart pounding.

At the time, he simply told me that it was a manageable condition and that he would be OK so long as he followed his course of medicine and listened to doctors orders in terms of looking after himself. I just took this as being the case. A couple of nights ago, however, for some reason I decided to investigate heart failure a little more and I have been devastated by my findings. I didn't realise that it's a condition that's probably going to kill him sooner rather than later. I spoke to my Dad about it last night and apparently, he doesn't know what stage/class (i.e. 1-4, A-D) he is at. I'm not sure whether I believe this - I think he's just trying to protect me from the reality of the situation. I asked him about his life expectancy etc and apparently, he doesn't know this either - he just reckons that he's going to look after himself so he can live as long as he can. Can anyone give me any more info? He's 53 years old and his heart failure is as a result of a faulty heart valve, something that was present at birth. He is slightly overweight but on the whole, he eats well. He works full time and it is quite an active job, so he gets exercise through this. He manages to go about normal activities well enough, such as going for a walk or doing the weekly shop. And He is controlling the condition through medication and always takes his meds as directed, he doesn't miss doses- the doc said he doesn't need an operation at the moment. In his last check up, he did a treadmill fitness test thing and he was only a few marks below the average for someone his age WITHOUT a bad heart. Can anyone tell me what the outlook is? I mean, if he was to continue to live sensibly as he is now, could he have a good few years left in him? As mentioned, he was diagnosed 5/6 years ago. I've also heard that heart failure is an umbrella term - is it possible to have a heart failure that isn't part of the classic 1-4 spectrum?

For about 2 weeks now ive been getting little sharp pains on the left side of my chest(mostly pec and a little below) and when it happens it seems like i have a harder time taking deep breaths and i feel panicky. I have been having these weird little pains in my body tho ever since 2008, i think the majority of why is because i was drinking more then 9 energy drinks a week from age 15-18 (19 now). But every time i went to the doctor he said i was fine and that was it? nothing more except your perfectly healthy Now here is what is worrying me. Last month a passed out dehydration and ever since is when ive been getting these sharpish pains and what not. I think anxiety has a big part cause ive been having dreams about passing out and i would wake up feeling my heart pounding. Also these pains have been lasting every day, not so much pain to where its unbearable or anything, but i know its there. Also it seems when i work out or do some sort of sporting event it worsens. I have been told that cause i do work out it can have somthing to do with that and i should just rest? btw im 19, i maybe eat bad once a week and i will have a diet soda a few times a week. Im physically fit being 6'0 170 and like i said, every time i went to the doctors they have said your fine . But what could this be? I dont have insurance so i havent been able to go to the ER.

HELP!," In the past month or so, this all came on.. I first thought I was being eaten alive by bugs at night, and that still may be. But, I've been waking with what look like spider and mosquito bites all over my body. Big welts on my hips (4 different times, right along the pantsline in the front) I've also had 4 swollen lips. Two in the top left corner and one in the bottom left and right. It looks like someone punched me in the mouth. It lasts about 24 hours, or less. It's become more frequent. I've never really had any allergies, so I have no idea what this is. I looked at pictures of hives, and it doesn't look quite like what I have. Mine look like bites, very specific. Mosquito bites and the welts look like spider bites. ALL of the symptoms appear the worst in the morning. I've thrown out my bed, and even went to stay with a friend for a few days.... washed everything I own. The bite (if they are even bites) seemed to get better but I still woke up with a really fat lip. I eat a very strict diet and don't waver from it. I could have developed an allergy, I suppose... but if it was a food allergy, it seems that I'd show effects soon after eating, and I never do. I've seen a few people with similar stories on this board, but the posts were outdated. I'm really hoping that someone will read this who has had some success in figuring out what it is. I'll be going to the doctor this week, of course... but 99% of the time, that yields no results.

I also like that it's one of the meds that isn't as likely to cause weight gain, which is another thing I like about Prozac.

I constantly feel physically and mentally tired and exhausted, neither sleep nor caffeine like that helps it. Everything bores me and things I used to enjoy just don't interest me any more. I don't really have motivation to do anything, and I'm starting to even lose the motivation to do something about this. I'm lacking sleep...no matter how tired I am, it's hard to sleep for more than ~3 hours a day.

I have difficulties remembering anything, but the hardest to remember are short term things. Nothing seems meaningful so I just forget everything. I don't even understand why I feel like this?? My life has always been ordinary, there just aren't any events that would especially make you feel bad or depressed...I've never done any drugs, my family is nice and so are my friends...I'm just a normal person. I used to cut myself as it would help this mood for a short time, but at a point I lost motivation to even continue that so I stopped it.

Anyway...in summer holiday I was in Japan where I actually felt good for the first time in ages. I could just talk to people in a normal way, had no problems doing everyday tasks and I actually had motivation to go on.

447472610,How should I manage or treat symptoms or conditions X?,No,,722005,I need some answers," I have a 17 year old daughter that was just recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy most likely caused by a virus. An accelerated heart rate was found by her PCP during a routine physical. The PCP immediately made her an appointment to see a pediatric cardiologist. He ordered every test imaginable for my daughter, all of which were normal, except the ECHO. Her heart is not constricting properly to pump the blood out of her heart. He scheduled her for a stress test and she was only able to stay on the treadmill 4 minutes before her heart rate went up. He is sending her to Atlanta for a cardiac MRI and we are presently waiting on the hospital to call to schedule that. He mentioned a heart cath to do a heart biopsy, but I get the impression he does not want to do that unless it is absolutely necessary. I guess that will depend upon what the MRI shows. He did tell us that her heart was not enlarged which was a good thing. I had never heard of anyone her age having heart failure. I, as well as her father, were totally shocked. The cardiologist told us this condition is extremely rare for someone her age. He has started her on a very low dose of linsinopril (which he plans to increase slowly) and will later add a beta blocker to her daily regimen. I do not know the extent of her heart damage nor the degree her heart is functioning. I do not know what I should ask when we meet with the doctor. I am also so afraid to hear what his answers will be. It is such a frightening thing to go through for my daughter as well as us as her parents. My daughter has always been very healthy. She's thin, exercises regularly and eats well. She danced, cheered and played sports. I do not understand why a virus would attack her heart. The doctor told us it's the same type virus that would cause a common cold in most people. For some unknown reason, her body is predisposed to the virus. The cardiologist that my daughter sees has very high credentials and is highly recommended. My cousin's daughter was born with heart kidney problems and the doctors she saw at Emory in Atlanta told her that this cardiologist is one of if not the best pediatric cardiologist in the county, so I feel she is in good hands. I just want to know that my daughter will be okay and will live a normal life albeit with medications and restrictions. If she does have some restrictions, what type of restrictions can we expect?

447472603,How should I manage or treat symptoms or conditions X?,No,,203839,Macademia nut allergy," I have recently been diagnosed with a relatively mild allergy to Macademia nuts. I have had a few mild reactions that included tingling mouth and upset stomach. My allergist has confirmed the diagnosis with a skin test and also shown with a skin test that I'm not allergic to other tree nuts. HOWEVER, the standard medical advice is to avoid all tree nuts if you are allergic to one. This has caused a good deal of anxiety on my part. The What-if scenarios are so scary. I haven't had a bad reaction yet, and, as far as anyone can tell, may never have one. Yet, the next exposure could be a severe anaphylactic reaction. Ugh. Subsequent calls to the allergist had him telling me not to worry too much. I have 2 epipens and the awareness of my allergy, therefore, I am armed to avoid and/or respond to a situation if it ever occurs. After shopping for the first time since I knew I was allergic, I have found that many of the foods I have been eating regularly have nuts in them! So I am a little confused about how alarmed I should be. The Honey Nut cheerios I eat with regularity have almond meal in them and I've never had a response. The doctor said to continue eating it. If I've been fine with certain breads and cereals to date, then I should continue. I guess what I'm getting at is, how am I supposed to deal with this allergy? I understand the potential for severe anaphylactic reactions is there, but how to gauge the likelihood? I've eaten pecans, pistachios, and almonds in the six months since I first detected an allergic response to macademias. I have no problem avoiding the whole nut, but should I stop eating every thing that might remotely have nut dust in it? the anxiety that anaphylaxis is waiting to happen after every meal is driving me crazy.

This situation will only change if I get a job and then save some money which i understand but the way I feel I need to get out of my house and move somewhere asap, every night I struggle to get to sleep (feel sick, paranoid, anxious and sometimes even like crying) last night I was in such a state and felt so trapped that I was considering packing up all my things there and then and ringing my parents to tell them I was moving back into theirs even though they have no space at their and live 100miles away (they moved up north 4 years ago). I have a doctor's appointment on Monday and am finally going to get medical advice but would like to hear from anyone who may have some words of comfort or even some harsh words if needs be for me to feel just even a bit better just to get me through the next few days. I have friends who I can talk to but I don't see them too often (settled down with partners) and although they try to they don't understand how I'm feeling and most of the time I get the feeling they think I'm just weird and need to get a job and find a girlfriend to 'sort' myself out. I don't know if it's depression or if I just need to stop being paranoid about my housemates or if I just need a job so I feel like I'm getting somewhere so any advice would be appreciated as it could be the 1st step on my road to recovery and maybe I might even shock myself and 'enjoy' life one day.

A few weeks back, I hit my right breast as I was carrying boxes outside and it hurt really bad, I THINK the pain started after that. The pains are usually a jolting pain that comes and goes, and it hurts to touch the breast. Today was the first day I could actually touch it since I was not in too much pain. I felt a couple lumps, checked my other breast and felts lumps too. I have to go to my doctor next month to get followed up on my dysplasia so I will have them do an exam on my breasts then...I have a very small frame, I am 5'5 and weigh 105 and have small breasts. Is it possible I am just feeling breast tissue? My question is, for woman with a lot of lumpy type breast tissue (hoping that is what these lumps are) how do we know it is not cancer? Do we go to the doctor every month? I found out my mother had breast cancer after she past away-she passed away due to something not related.

447472611,"What is the cause of symptoms, conditions, or test findings X?",No,,842668,Heartbeat Irregularity," Hi everybody! (sorry this is so long ;) ) I'm a 21 year old male currently living in another country for a few months (through a school program). I'm very active and practice a lot of climbing, dance, and a fair bit of other sports. I'd say I'm in good shape, though a little on the thin side. About a month ago I was checking my heart rate before going to sleep (not something I do habitually), and really freaked out when I thought it was skipping beats. However, after I calmed down a bit I noticed my heart was jumping quicker whenever I breathed in and dropping when I breathed out, and was averaging around 80 bpm. I scheduled an appointment with a doctor though it was four days later. I had trouble sleeping during that time because of worry. The doctor checked my pulse and said it was a little high, probably due to the stress of being in another country (france), and also perhaps the minor allergies (slightly irritated nose) from my host family owning a cat. He prescribed some allergy medication and cardiocalm (hawthorn based heart relaxant) and told me to come back in a week if the problem was not resolved. The cardiocalm did bring my heart rate down a little bit (In hindsight I think the elevated heart rate was probably due to worrying about my heart and not sleeping enough because of this), but the variation with breathing persisted. The doctor sent me to a cardiologist and I had an electrocardiogram. The new doctor said my heart rate was quick, though nothing was actually wrong with my heart. There was a bit of a language barrier as well, but I'm fairly certain he noticed a small increase in the rate with breathing. A week later I took a stress test on a bicycle and the output showed my heart to behave normally without any increase with breathing, though apparently my maximum heart rate is 176 bpm. I asked him about the variation but he sorta just dismissed it (again, a little bit of a problem with language--I'm definitely not fluent in french). I was given the ok to continue exercising and told to come back if I had any other problems. That was three days ago. However, two things are still bothering me: My heart rate is still varying with each breath, and this is especially prominent when I'm going to sleep, and seems to disappear when exercising (hence it not showing up on the stress test). The drop after exhaling is very sudden and occasionally feels like a little 'thump' when I am trying to sleep, and I think there might be the occasional missed beat associated with that. So should I go back to the doctor and have them check again, as I think just being a little stressed out might have been hiding the original irregularity in an elevated heart rate? I'm not as stressed out after the EKG but it is still troublesome as I don't ever remember noticing anything like this variation before. Also, I went for a jog today and I'm fairly sure my heart rate just about exceeded 200bpm. This is worrisome as I've always had excellent endurance and lots of activities I partake in require a lot more exertion than simple jogging. If I try hill sprints or some other form of intense and prolonged workout like I used to am I in danger of stressing my heart out too much? (I'm considering purchasing a cheap heart rate monitor, just to keep an eye on things). p.s. I don't drink (coffee/alcohol), and my diet hasn't changed too much since I've been here. I'm also a generally calm and unstressed person though this has managed to unnerved me quite a bit. I love my heart and it is very unsettling too have such a vital piece of myself behaving so unusually. Thanks! Hopefully someone can help me out here! -James",65,0.196932252

447489589,How should I manage or treat symptoms or conditions X?,No,,500319,Can Someone help?," First off, I am originally from Texas. I am a 24 year old male. I now live in Pisa, Italy. I am on a waiting list to get an allergy test/screening from my nearest American hospital here. I had seasonal allergies as a teen, but after about my 20th birthday they had all disappeared. Until I moved to Italy. They have such bad pollen, you have no idea. You can actually see clouds of yellow pollen in the air. It is as thick as fog. My allergy symptoms have gone through the roof. I accept the allergy to pollen, but Claritin does nothing for me. I have to take that and benedryl, along with vitamins, to even somewhat keep it in check. This only solves a small part of my problems. I still can only breath through one nostril, barely, and sometimes not even that. I had septoplasty done about a year and a half ago. I had a severely deviated septum, and a large mass of tissue that engulfed half of my sinuses. When they opened that portion up, I think that might have added more surface area to come in contact with dust, pollen and whatnot. Also that part of my sinuses hasn't been exposed to allergens in years, so it just of all of a sudden had to take on these countless invaders. Well besides that, and the utmost dying need/want to relieve those problems, I have found that I cannot eat certain foods. They are as follows: Apples Oranges Peaches Watermelon Strawberries Avocado Peanuts Walnuts Pecans Pistachio Soy Carrots Broccoli and countless other fruits and vegetables My symptoms when I eat these foods vary greatly. For instance I can eat peanut butter, but not peanuts plain. My symptoms range from mild throat irritation, to full on wheezing, pain throughout my throat mouth, and a swollen esophagus. I read I might have oral allergy symptom, but it can be so mild sometimes, and horrible the next. I think I am also allergic to grass, and my mother told me as a child I was allergic to Penicillin. I have to wear a med alert necklace for the penicillin thing. I avoid those foods, but to what consequence, my body needs these to be healthy, so I resort to vitamins. These allergies affect my life so much, that it leads to uncontrollable irritability, and anger. I cant sleep at night because I cant breath. I also have three small dogs and I know that I am allergic to them, but I love them and I deal with that allergy as much as I can. I have an air purifier, and the dogs aren't allowed in my room. Even though my female chihuahua is pregnant and sleeps in there for now so we can watch her. Once again something I am dealing with because of love. I envy people that don't have allergies, and I wish my life was better. I really need to find out whats going on with my body, and what medications I can take that will work... I am sick and tired of these sugar pills that do nothing to help..I know allergies are a tough cookie to figure out but someone somewhere has to know of something I can take that will fix some of these problems. Also should I talk again with my primary care doctor? I don't think they understand the severity of this. My allergies can be triggered quickly, and since they are all internal, nobody believes me, especially about it being hard to breath. By the time I go into the doctor, the symptoms have faded. I am in the military, and we do PT (physical training) in the morning. We used to do it in a gym, and that was fine, but now that good weather is here they do it on a soccer field. I have to warm up on the grass and then run for miles afterwards. I do it because, well I have to, but to what effect, I could fall out and pass out because its hard to breath. I got a note from my doctor saying that I cant come into contact with allergens while I PT, but my bosses just told me not to do push ups on the ground...but I have to do PT on the grass still, like running in place, jumping jacks and so forth. All of which make grass particles flow in the air like clouds. The only alternative they gave me was doing PT on the sidewalk in front of the whole squadron....and since I'm not one to be singled out, I just do it on the grass...Plus I don't know what allergens to avoid, so the note my doctor wrote is up to someones interpretation. I just want them to go away, anyone who knows or can understand what I am going through, please give me advice. The only season I live happy, is the dead of winter, and then my pet allergy isn't even a problem as I guess since that it is the only thing that could bother me, my immune system fights it off no problem.....please please any advice would be meet with great appreciation.

I have been a regular gym-goer, don't drink nor smoke but have had slightly high BP for 4/5 years but not at a treat:)able level according to my GP. An ECG suggested a heart working too hard and a possible enlarged heart (although 2 medical staff thought my results were fine my GP wasn't sure and suggested this). I also had a Normal Sinus rythm with sinus arythmia. Finally, I am also on medication in case the episodes are caused by an inner ear infection.

It was caused by a 100% blocked LAD, and happened last friday (4 days back). I am only now understanding how lucky I am to be even writing this.

I felt downright STUPID as I made the call, but by the time they got here ~5 minutes later, I was reeling in pain and in the middle of a full fledged attack. They got me to a hospital quickly and my LAD had been cleared and stented within 90-120 minutes of the initial pain. Reason I am writing is to get some input from the experts here on what to ask my cardiologist. I am meeting him for my first post-attack, detailed discussion in 2 days. Frankly, I cannot understand how I could have a heart attack... ...I am 38 ...have always been ultra sporty, outdoorsy etc (A wannabe-athlete whose eagerness and desire exceeded his talent is how I would describe myself) ...Been working out 8-10 times/month for the last few years ...6 feet tall and have been ~175 pounds or less my whole life ...have had regular healthcheckups although no cardiac stress test ...no family history, Blood pressure always about 120/80 or lower ...cholesterol has been medium to high but not ridiculous (Total: 200-260 for last 4-5 years, but HDL always between 50-65; Total was measured to be 190 the day of the attack). I was trying to get my cholesterol down HARD the last few years via exercise and diet and was loath to get onto statins unless essential ...I have a very healthy diet. I'm a big fan of oatmeal, fruits, vegetables, grains and lentils. And I have limited red meat to 5-6 times/month or less for the last many years. ...don't smoke. ...Drink alcohol but not a lot (~5-20 glasses of mostly red wine per week) I want to understand from my cardiologist...:confused: 1. How does a guy like me get a heart attack at 38? If I'd known, I definitely would not have stayed off those steaks, desserts and Big Macs :) 2.

I had some lightheadedness and some nausea. At the moment, I have a little bit of lightheadedness, but I've never been close to fainting. The nausea is not as intense, but it's still there. That's my current situation, here is the background: I'm currently in China. Friday night was a very heavy night of drinking. and I went to a Chinese wedding, and being the only foreigner, they just wanted to drink with me, and get me drunk. I don't usually smoke, but I smoked pretty heavily that night. The next morning I was shaking, but I figured that was from the alcohol. I didn't notice any palpitations at the time. I went and had a big lunch, and then went back to sleep until 6. When I woke up, I felt like my heart was fluttering. I also had some serious nausea and a bit of dizziness. I decided to wait 2 days (probably stupid, I know), just to see if it was something temporary. But it wasn't. I haven't passed out or fainted, and I've been getting lots of sleep. I went to the doctor yesterday, and they gave me two EKGs, a quick X-ray, blood and urine testing. I went to a sort of rural area hospital that, while professional, didn't seem up to par. Regardless, they did all that work and they couldn't find anything. My heart rate was 73 bpm. They mentioned that it could be a slight irregular beat. As of now, the palpitations are slightly less, or I've just gotten used to them more. I couldn't really eat before, but yesterday I managed 2 meals after being in a hospital for a number of hours. I don't have a history of heart palpitations, and I've generally been in good health. I drink and occasionally smoke on the weekends. Should I make a trip up to a better hospital? I'm not too far away from an urban area and a much larger hospital, or is it not that serious?

There was a year in my life where I decided to experiment with cocaine and exstacy (but could honestly count on 2 hands the times I did either) and that was about 4 years ago. I get pretty regular chest pains and arms pains that do scare me. I am 6'1 , 32 yrs old, and weigh 350lbs. Over the past year, I have seen my primary care physician and had an ekg done. It came back normal. He said it was likely acid reflux. I then self-referred to a cardiologist who did an ekg which also came back normal. My concerns continued so he ordered a stress test which came back normal. A few months later, I visited again because of growing concern and he ordered a nuclear stress test. After that, he said that blood flow was good and the heart was strong. He feels that I just need to lose weight (understandably so). We did go over things and he feels that it is musculo-skeletal pain. He also explained I likely was experiencing PVCs at one point after I went in with complaints that it feels like my heart was skipping beats. He said that it's typically nothing to be concerned with. Since then, they have gone away with the exception of about a week or two ago, when I experienced some PVC pain for a short while. I do get pain usually in the left forearm or elbow area. Since last night, I have been experiencing pain in my upper left arm, almost in the tricep area (sort of hard to really pinpoint though). If it's not heart trouble, what the heck is it? I just want it to stop/go away so that I dont feel like I'm dying if I really am not. Generally, I experience chest pain/discomfort with the arm pain. Sometimes its just the arm. I have also had pain in the left side of my jaw line as well as moments where it feels like I could be having a very light asthma attack. I guess the next step would be to have a heart cath done, but I REALLY do not want that since I have read about many complications that can occur from having one done. :( Also, I very likely suffer from sleep apnea.

From countless hours of research/diagnosis attempts from doctors with no answers, I had decided to attempt to live with this horrible sickness. BUT, I am so depressed. All of my bathroom supplies claim they are natural but they are not enough. Everywhere I turn, chemicals/perfumes are everywhere. I have turned into the biggest head case in the world it seems. I can smell EVERYTHING and when I do, I get weak/dark eyes/bags under my eyes/ chalky throat and major brain fog. If you could only see the bags that I develop under my eyes as I come in contact with chemicals/perfumes etc. It is like night and day. I never thought in all of my life that I would become constantly depressed (over something like this) I have a great job/great friends/family. This sickness overpowers all- I am 25 years old, what am I going to do? It is so hard for me to live like this--what is it going to be like when I am 35. There is no one that I can talk to---this sickness makes no sense at all! I am very scared. I want to cure this. But the symptoms are so abnormal to target. Is it Candida, is it MCS, is it immune deficiency, is it my liver? I don't even have a diagnosis. How do I find one - it seems like none of the physicians/doctors understand. What deficiency in my body is causing this pain? It has to be a deficiency; my body is missing something very important/very normal that everyone else has. I used to be so so healthy. This sickness really brings me down. Please tell me that something you have done has lessoned your symptoms/gives you relief? Is it only the fragrances or is it the actual chemical makeup of the products that cause you pain? What does unscented regular lotion do for you, do you still get sick if you apply it to your skin? Not only is mine chemical/perfumes etc. Coffee and alcohol really makes me have the dry face/dry eyes/chalky throat. This leads to me to think it is some sort of Candida. But I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t crave any sweets/sugars, or have any type of bowel disorder. I don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t care about deserts and I honestly don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8217;t go to the bathroom enough. I research Candida the most. But why/how would a yeast/fungal overgrowth cause my body to act this way from fragrances. Do you know of any test one can take/doctors can give (other than the saliva test in the morning when you wake up) to tell if you have true Candida? Have you ruled out Candida? I see that you get relief from working out and taking a hot shower. Is this the only thing that gives you relief? Is there anything else that makes you feel better?

My movements have been severely restricted for two years, I can no longer do physical work in our construction company, I wake up every night in pain, and have difficulty doing simple household chores, it even hurts to type this. The insurance company that required me to get that test to qualify moved the effective date up, after they found out I was hurt, so they wouldn't have to cover it. I didn't sue, because it's the only hospital within two hours distance and I am worried that if someone in my family needed emergency care, they wouldn't be treated properly. After the hospital found out what happened, they apologized and then billed me for it. NO women's health awareness group has ever stated the risks involved, they hide it from women while telling them to get these tests every year, even if they are not at risk and I had no symptoms or family history. I never heard of hiding risks of medical tests from patients before, let alone lying about the safety of them. Something is really wrong with this picture and that comment about the lawyers is false, they can look at the mammogram pictures to prove your mother was not positioned properly. It is obvious in mine. I am not encouraging anyone to go without a mammogram, but we have a right to know what's involved and make informed decisions based on our own risk factors and potential dangers of the tests. These are OUR bodies, not the government's, the insurance agencies', the self appointed spokespeople for our causes, or the people who make money off us.

447472344,"Story telling, news, sharing or asking about experience, or soliciting support.",No,,24710,I declined chemo &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; had my ovaries out instead," This is an I-declined-chemo-and-got-my-ovaries-out instead-and-lived-to-tell-about-it story: Hi, I have never met anyone who did what I did, and just want to share my story. Five years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 38 (invasive ductal carcinoma, stage II, plus DCIS, ER positive). I had no family history of breast cancer and had never smoked or done drugs. I'd been a dancer and runner and was otherwise very healthy. I had a lumpectomy, but declined chemo, radiation, and axilary disection, got married, and got pregnant with twins (!) right away. I declined chemo that first time because I knew it would probably wipe out my fertility and I just HAD to try and have children. (By the way, right after I got pregnant I read about that Danish study where women who have children after breast cander diagnosis live longer than women who don't, so that made me feel good!) I declined the radiation after I did library research that indicated that it had no effect on survival, just reduced the chance of local recurrance. The bummer was that I got a local recurrance seven months after the babies were born. (I had fraternal twin boys who weighed 6.11 lbs. and 7.3 lbs. Whoppers! The pregnancy was completely normal. They are wonderful, smart, fun kids.) I had a lumpectomy and (separately) a sentinel node procedure with the famous Dr. Guilliani which revealed micrometastis to the sentinel node. So now I was stage III and needed to have a full mastectomy. I cried all the way home from the appointment where I found out that I had lymph node involvement. I have a Ph.D. from UCLA, plus I'm a college professor, so I know my way around university libraries, so I embarked upon a second round of intense library research (the first round occured two years prior when I got my initial diagnosis). I found information at the UCLA Bio/Med Library about the removal of ovaries, or oophorectomy, as an alternative treatment to chemo for estrogen positive pre-menopausal breast cancer patients and set my mind to do this and avoid poisoning myself. My gynocologist who'd delivered my twins said she wouldn't do it unless I had an oncologist who would endorse the scheme. She'd never heard of this. They do oophorectomies for breast cancer much more often in England and Scotland and Europe, but hardly ever in the US. My husband and family dragged me to seven oncologist consultation appointments (UCLA Revlon Breast Clinic, USC, John Wayne Cancer Clinis, plus other big shot names.) I always took along my research articles and said I wanted to get my ovaries out and skip chemo. None of them had ever heard about this. One guy said, Are you crazy, lady? Don't you want to live to see your children grow up? They all talked down to me and said I had to have chemo and that they knew just the perfect cocktail/regimen to put me on. Finally, I found oncologist, Dr. John Link, who knew about the research statistics I had and agreed that it was a completely reasonable treatment choice for me. I ended up have 11 hours of surgury at USC. I had a simultaneous mastectomy, oophorectomy, and tummytuck Free TRAM reconstruction (where they make you a new boob out of your transplanted tummy fat). It's now three years later. My kids will turn 4 in November and my bloodwork is normal and I have no signs of recurrance! So far, so good. With no ovaries, I am menopausal, of course. I have hot flashes, but they are not dibilitating. I have also gained weight, but I'm not sure if this is due to menopause or because I like ice cream. My husband and I do use Astroglide (a wonderful product) when we fool around, as I don't have normal vaginal lubrication. My worst symptom I'd say is pretty bad insomnia, although I'm not as bad as I used to be. When I had those ovaries, I could sleep 9 or 10 hours at a time, but now I can only hope for 5 1/2 or 6. Sometimes I have a hard time falling asleep and I can't stay asleep; I wake up a lot. To be totally honest, I would have to admit that I'm not as up and cheerful as I once was. My readings suggest that this (slight depression) can be related to menopause, too, but I don't know, maybe it's related to CANCER! My last symptom is memory loss. I can't remember a %$#@ing thing, like I used to, but my other friends with kids swear that pregnancy makes you lose your mind. Hmmm. But on the whole, I'm glad I avoided chemo. Statistically, I have achieved the same survival benefit as undergoing chemo. For me it was the right choice. It amazes me that US doctors don't know much about oophorectomy as a hormone therapy for breast cancer. It seems that breast cancer patients should be given ALL their options before they my their choices. But then again, an oncologist sees maybe $25,000.00 walking through the door when a breast cancer patient walks into his office, right? How much would an oncologist make if he or she refered the patient to a surgeon for an oophorectomy? If your tumor markers are estrogen receptor positive and you're premenopausal and you haven't made your treatment decisions yet, you might want to go to a medical school library and do a Medline search or journal article search on ovarian ablation and breast cancer and oophorectomy and breast cancer, before you let your oncologist sign you up for chemo. At least you'll be more fully informed about your options. My husband wants me to write a book about my experience with the oncological community and fighting cancer on my own terms. Maybe I will if I can find the time! This is the first time I've written anything at all about this. Let me know if this helps anyone. Best wishes to you all.

I'm 32 and have been going to a new therapist since the summer. I love her, which is great! I always knew my issues stemmed from my family. I love them very much but have to make changes for myself. That's the tough part; how do you change your behaviors, for yourself, after living your life for others for so many years? Growing up, my older brother, had much of the power in my house. My parents (more mom) enabled him because she didn't want fights or for his temper to blow. My mom grew up with an alcoholic mother so she in turn was soooo overprotective of us but gave him the power because she didn't want the turmoil. My brother took enough chances and did all the crazy things for both of us. So I NEVER took chances because I didn't want to disappoint my parents. I was the good little girl. I hated myself so I turned to food. Relationships with men have always been hard because I didn't want people to see me as broken. They never last long and I crumble when they end. I'm very close with my parents but since this has all surfaced for me, I'm very angry at them at the same time. This is all where my depression has come from. I'm TERRIFIED at the thought of them not being here one day. I mean to the point where there are days I sob like they are gone already. As I type, I feel myself getting upset. They want nothing more than to be happy for me. Yet I feel guilty doing things for me. So many emotions at one time. I have great friends yet I can't lose the feeling of loneliness. Part of me feels that if I try to be happy, something will happen and it will be my fault because I wasn't there. I was always the go to person in my family. It's broken me! How do I change for myself, without feeling guilty or angry?",44,0.750516155

Still don't sleep without waking; but it is better than just lying awake all night. I have treatment on Thursdays so I use the weekend to recoup and back to work fulltime on Monday. The fatigue is pretty strong; about a 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Had to get shot last week for my red blood cells; it was just barely below where dr. wanted it to be. My hair started coming out about day 18 and went ahead and had it shaved; so glad I did. I wear bandanas/do rags(sp?) and baseball caps to work and a wig to church. My husband had his head shaved too the same day we went to get my done; pretty emotional at the time; but I'm okay now; it will grow back! My last treatment will be Nov. 8th. Question: 1. Should I expect similar side effects from Taxol as the AC? 2. Also, my mastectomy site is still sore some; went to surgeon and he said yes, the area is pulling but in a while it will all relax again. Is that what ya'll have experienced? 3. I dislike my port. seems it has shifted some and raised up higher than before.

First off he was young, 54, and his death was very shocking and totally unexpected for everyone. Here's what happened. It was on a sunday. He woke up and like every other sunday ate breakfast with my mom as they were going to walk their dogs (a sunday morning ritual for them). He acted no differently than he normally does--he laughed, joked with me, ate without a problem, etc. And then the unthinkable happened. Right as he was going to leash up one of their dogs he just collapsed right in front of my Mom, his heart stopped. NO warning WHATSOEVER. He didnt complain of chest pain or numbness that is associated with a person just before they are about to have a heart attack, he didnt act funny--no signs, NOTHING. We called a paramedic and they got there within 5 minutes. During the time we waited my Mom and I were administering CPR. Paramedics arrived and he was rushed to the emergency. Long story short, he never regained conscionsness. He had a massive heart attack. This has been the most devastating thing to happen to us. I'm not coping well at all. Im 25 years old and my father is gone. He was active and should of had at least 20 more years left. I just have so many questions, I dont understand how this could of happened. My father did have a silent heart attack about 15 years ago which he had to have a stint put in, but absolutely no problems since then. He did however continue to smoke. Hes been smoking since he was 20. Im just a little suspicious about things. Everyone thing Ive read online says that there is at LEAST some kind of warning leading up to a heart attack. I mean he literally just collapsed without a word or a single sound and never came to. He was hanging around some friends the night before drinking (he was a social drinker) and having a good time. No autopsy was done because the hospital believed that since he had that silent heart attack years ago that it was basically just heart disease related, and the medical examiner apparently came to the same conclusion.

I stumbled across it searching for Pristiq side effects. I've seen several posts where the person refers to brain zaps -- what exactly are those? Here's my story in a nutshell: I had my physical last week. My B/P was 150 over 106. My doctor asked how my Lexapro was doing, and I told him it keeps me from crying, but doesn't motivate me to do anything else. I just come home and curl up in a chair. It takes everything I have to get out of bed in the morning (my poor snooze alarm!) and to even pay bills. He decided to try me on Pristiq, saying his other patients have had pretty good luck with it. He gave me a two-week sample. I think the norepinephrine in it is what made my heart beat faster, which is scary to me, since I take another drug to slow my heart down (I have a heart murmur and mitral valve prolapse). After reading the literature on the Pristiq side effects (rapid heartbeat was one), I noticed that it should not be taken by persons with uncontrolled hypertension -- which he had just told me mine was NOT controlled . By Sunday (Day 5), I was restless and ended up re-hanging photos on the walls, moving stuff around the house, and going full steam ... soooo restless! Normally I sleep most of the weekends (and evenings) away. No naps this time! I went to bed around midnight Sunday and didn't go to sleep until 3 AM. When I did finally fall asleep, I had weird dreams/nightmares that woke me up. It was bizarre. When I closed my eyes to try to get back to sleep, I kept seeing what I can only describe as kaleidoscope patterns. It was like I was drunk. I remember wondering if this was what being on LSD would be like. I decided to give it another try and took the 6th day dose on Monday. My heart was driving me nuts, and I was starting to feel like a zombie -- like I did when he tried me on Prozac (I only lasted 7 days on that). Today I didn't take the medication and feel like I'm going through detox. I'm supposed to call my doctor tomorrow (Wednesday) anyway to give him an update, and I think I'll give him hell instead! Why would a doctor give someone a drug knowing that the side effects are something the patient already has?!! It doesn't make sense to me. Has anyone had any luck by adding Abilify to their existing medication? I was thinking about asking about taking that with the Lexapro. Thanks for listening -- it's nice to know I'm not alone in going through this horrible Pristiq experience!",44,0.52051255

As the days passed, I realized that I really wasn't ready to be discharged. I was more anxious in society after the hospital than before. I am more confrontational with people now and for a while I was actively suicidal where I cut up my wrists and did research on carbon monoxide poisoning. The wrist-cutting was actually more for self-mutilation than any real attempt at suicide. Death still scares me, even though living scares me too. I'm in a limbo. When I sliced up the skin under my wrists, it bled for a while. I went to sleep hoping that maybe I would bleed to death as I slept and have the opportunity to die in my sleep. I was scared to die but I was trying to build up courage to committ suicide eventually. Anyway, when I awoke, I was surprised to see the wound had closed up. Now there is a scar but it is not very noticeable and it is disappearing. I have read that cutting your wrists can tear up tendons and cause bodily injury. I can feel these tendons but they seem very rigid. Are they deeper than the veins? That is, would I need to cut deeper to hit the tendons, or would I get to the veins first? And is it possible to actually bleed to death from cutting veins? It seems like an unlikely thing since someone could cut a vein by accident so easily. Right now, the best case scenario is that I get better (but I don't feel this can happen). The next best case is that I somehow die. Worst case is I continue being alive depressed, in this awful limbo I'm in right now. Worst of all, possibly, is I have enough guts to cut myself deep enough but hit tendons and don't bleed enough to die and then I get to live with an added problem (hand injury) on top of my mental pain.",44,0.748913031

I have had depression for most of my life. I have my ups and downs, and I seem to be on a gradual increase for the bettter except for now I am going through a huge life change. I graduated college 2 yrs ago with a degree in criminal justice, minor in pyschology. I have not been able to get a good job since getting out. I have been drinking a lot, going to bars, partying with friends from college and in reality just sinking lower. I have been loseing my hair, gaining some wieght, have very little money, have not had a steady girlfriend for a long time.....my depression and low self-image have kept me from that(despite many of them being interested) I lost my job that kept me paying my bills about 4 months ago. My work performance had been sinking, I made a mistake on some paperwork and a gun came missing ina shipment(for a moveing company) and I got canned. I got a low paying job that helped me get through the rest of my housing lease and I am now currently helping my dad out with his buisness. he has a remote lodge in Alaska and I am watching it for him while he is gone. So now I am completely alone, living under the whims of my father until I get my life together. I am super depressed because between prematurely balding, putting on some wieght from the drinking I don't feel attractive anymore. I never realized how much your own attractiveness level can make you feel how succesful you are going to be. Also not haveing any money, being 38,000 in debpt from college. I am really considering joining the military right now. I could go in as an officer and most likely get into a pilot program because I do have a private pilot's license. For the next couple of months while I am living alone I am going to quit drinking completely, study for military tests(ASVAB) and (AFAST), as well as apply for jobs, exercise a bunch and eat healthy.

My mom (72 y.o.) has (what seems to be) a cyst (diameter of 3 cm) in her right breast. The surgeon suggested she has a mastectomy for the following reasons: 1. In case of lumpectomy, if the biopsy is positive to cancer (a very low probability = 10 % according to him) mom will have to go through surgery again. This would expose her to greater risks. She suffered a stroke 8 months ago, and even one surgery is risky, let alone two. Radiation is out of the question. 2. Mom has small breasts and a removal of the lump alone wouldn't much breast anyway. I'm really worried about the psycological impact the mastectomy might have on her. Ok. she's above 70 but who'se to say that she will not face such problems. Neither me nor my dad and my brother can even remotely understand how important the breasts can be for a woman. Also the mastectomy is a much more agressive procedure than lumpectomy. This means she will be exposed to a more risky surgery with longer recovery times. He notified us only a day ago (I wonder why since the surgery was programmed also 3 months ago) and mom needs to make a very quick decision. Is the surgeon taking the easy way out?

I even had a carotid ultrasound done in 2002 for a Free LifeLine Screening that I attended and my carotid arteries were fine. I'm worried that it's not related to the mitral valve and it is something more sinister. Does anyone know more about this. I do not have high blood pressure or cholesterol. Could plaque still build up without having cholesterol, etc... problems???? Thank you very your input. I truly appreciate it",65,0.163921717

I've been in so much pain lately and can't remember what life is like without having pain and the feeling that in general, something is really really wrong.

Last month the pain worsened so I saw a doc again and had another mammogram and an ultrasound. A few small lumps were found but nothing appeared to be problematic. Nothing was found in the painful area but there is a notable change in architcture in that particular area so the radiologist ordered a breast MRI which my insurance will not approve as they deem the procedure investigative. I have lost focus as the pain is beginning to take over my life. Because of other health issues, Tylenol is all I can take for pain. This does nothing. I don't enjoy hugs from family and friends anymore. Pain pain pain. I have changed bras, cut out caffeine, eat very healthy foods.

Since I can remember I have always been able to hear my heatbeat in my ears when everything is quiet (e.g. just before going to sleep). As well as this, I have also always been able to feel my heartbeat throughout my body. This isn't constant, sometimes I can't feel it, but usually at any given moment I can. I can even feel the very slight difference between when my heat beats and when it reaches my fingertips. Often, when I lie down to do go sleep, I can hear my heartbeat, and also feel my body sort of reverberating on each beat and even feels like I am 'moving' on each beat. Sometimes this can really make it hard to get to sleep just from the annoyance factor. Anyway, I have never mentioned this to a doctor or in fact *anyone* before, but the other day my girlfriend asked why I couldnt sleep and I just told her it was because my heart was making me vibrate more than usual. I'm 28 and have had this all my life but I only just found out that this may not be 'normal' and that not everyone gets it, according to my girlfriend. I have never told anyone, just like I have never told anyone that my fingernails grow.

There is a stable asymmetry in the right breast posterior depth central to the nipple seen on the mediolateral oblique view only. There is a focal asymmetry with associated heterogeneous calcifications in the left breast at 1 o�clock posterior depth. Targeted ultrasound demonstrates a corresponding irregular hypoechoic mass with an indistinct boarder. Vascularity (blood flow is flowing) is present. Sonographic evaluation of the axilla demonstrates only normal appearing lymph nodes. No lymphadenopathy is identified. Physical exam does not reveal a corresponding suspicious palpable abnormality. No other significant masses or calcifications are seen in either breast. IMPRESSION: SUSPICIOUS OF MALIGNANCY, TARGETED ULTRASOUND SUSPICIOUS OF MALIGNANCY. The stable asymmetry in the right breast posterior depth central to the nipple seen on the mediolateral obique view only is benign.

She has been on Zyrtec, Acular Eye drops, Claritan and most recently Allegra. Her Dr just moved her her up to Allegra 180 this past week(she had been on 60mg). This past fall/winter she started to have a constant sinus drainage. The ENT prescribed a nasal wash and that only caused sore throats. The Dr gave us a sample of Flonase and that also caused sore throats. She started her Allegra this fall when allergy season hit and it seemed to stop some of the drainage but it is still quite bad. I was really hoping that the Allegra 180 would dry her up, but after a week there doesn't seem to be any signs that it is doing that. Tonight I found a product called Antiseptic Sino Fresh. The box claims that it kills nasal mold and bacteria and is good for people that suffer from post nasal drip and that it is non addictive. Has anyone here tried this Sino Fresh? I really need to find something that works without causing sore throats. She has enough of those already. I am wondering if allergy testing wouldn't be a good idea. We saw the Dr this past week and he said that some people just have more drainage than other people and this is just something that she may need to live with. She hasn't always had this as it only started last fall. Have any of you that suffer from the draining problem ...always had the problem ? Just one more question I promise LOL.

It would come and go and the chest pain, I actually thought was related to just starting melatonin for insomnia. The chest pain started within a week of taking the melat....So I stopped taking it, but...obviously the pain and symptoms didn't stop. It got to the point that on June 23, I couldn't take it anymore and went to an urgent care - had normal ekg and normal chest xray...ekg did, however, show something like left ventricular... maybe the word hypertrophy was in there somewhere. That said, I remember docs pointing something out to me in the past but saying that as long as it had always been there (and I was in my 20's through early 30's at the time), it was nothing to worry about. The u.c. doc said that the ekg would need further diagnostic review if that result was new. Regardless, she wasn't fussed about that. She gave me some aciphex and some xanax and said that it's likely to be anxiety...and it made sense, and seemed to calm down a bit. Then, last Thursday, my husband made me laugh unexpectedly (a quick belly-laugh) and I felt like my chest shredded. I couldn't take a full breath, I was feeling it in the upper quadrant of my left chest and also along the bottom of my last rib on the left - about 3 or 4 finger-widths from my sternum. I'm now having recurrent, but intermittent pains that seems to be sharp when I laugh. I can cough (or force a cough) without much pain if any at all. But now, the whole left chest just feels sore and it's starting to hurt into my shoulder and collarbone.

I am an eleventh year survivor of a challenging case of prostate cancer, using an investigational therapy known as triple androgen deprivation therapy (with bisphosphonate and nutritional/exercise/stress reduction support), doing very well. Virtually all of my posts are on the Prostate Cancer board, but I thought participants on the Breast Cancer board might be interested in a report on the AACR meeting that I posted Wednesday evening. If you are interested, you can find it on the Prostate Cancer board under this title: Your Representative at the American Assn. for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, 2010. You can spot it easily by the glowing lightbulb symbol in the margin. I just did a search of the HealthBoards system and found that no other participant in the AACR's Scientist&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8596;Survivor Program (SSP) was posting about the event on the Breast Cancer board, so I decided to share my report more widely. I'm going to suggest that some of the breast cancer SSP participants post here, but until that happens, you will have my report. I was not there as a medical professional. In fact, I have no enrolled medical education but was participating in a special program that brings about forty survivors to each year's five day annual conference. Most of us were survivors like me, without medical credentials. While I was there specifically to represent prostate cancer survivors, much of the meeting, and much of my report, apply to cancer generally. The Scientist&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#8596;Survivor Program included survivors representing many kinds of cancers. The more common cancers were more heavily represented, as you might expect, but there were at least two of us who represented rare ( orphan ) cancers. The Komen Foundation is a major sponsor of the entire AACR conference, as well as a supporter of the SSP, so there is usually ample representation from the breast cancer community. This year there were nineteen SSP participants involved with breast cancer. Breast cancer organizations, and organizations represented by breast cancer survivors included: Susan G. Komen for the Cure; Virginia Breast Cancer Foundation; the Hungarian League Against Cancer; African American cancer Support Group, Inc.; Stand Up 2 Cancer; Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation; SHARE - Self Help for Women with Breast or Ovarian Cancer; Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center; Breast Cancer Resource Center (Austin, Texas); Sharsheret; and Native People's Circle of Hope. I was most impressed with my SSP colleagues who were representing breast cancer survivors. As you might expect, many of the presentations at the conference dealt with breast cancer. The AACR is more toward the basic end of the research spectrum, so you see things there that have not yet been published in peer reviewed medical research journals. If you read my report and post a response on the Prostate Cancer Board, I'll read it and respond if appropriate to that board (if it's general or not pertaining to another cancer), or I'll try to post a response on the appropriate board.

I have COPD and Congested Heart Failure. I am on O2 therapy 24/7 ( 14 mths) at 8 lpm. Over the last 14 months I have suffered maybe 8 or 9 tachycardia episodes that abated naturally. This last one has been going on for a week now with a range of 55-160 bpm. Finally two days ago I went to the Doctor (gen practitioner) and he did an EKG and diagnosed I my tachycardia was atrial fibrillation. He upped my Diltazem from 180mg to 300mg. He also mentioned the possibility of needing a pacemaker. My travel is limited and I live in an isolated small city without a practicing cardiologist. So it's a general practitioner doctor and self education at the moment for me. Prior to this last episode I had three weeks where I felt the very best since my hospitalization 14 months ago. I even hiked a little way up a ski mountain, while walking the dogs. Of course all my walking is with a O2 tank on my back. Anyway I am wondering how long I can go with the rates of tachycardia(do understand blood clotting/stroke dilemma) I am suffering now. Also let me mention I am not afraid to die and just don't want to suffer a much more diminished life style. Kinda interested in any information or advise off the top of your head any might have for me. I know I have given you a limited amount of information but am willing to go more in depth with any questions that might help you understand my situation. God",65,0.317383407

Two year ago, my daughter would have chest pains during basketball practice and I was referred to a pediatric cardiologist. The specialist did an ultrasound and found nothing wrong with her heart. The chest pains eventually subsided about a year later. Since then, my daughter has gone through a huge growth spurt (6 inches in less than 6 months). I took her for her sports physical and the doctor said that she has a split heart sound. She didn't want to follow up with anything because my daughter had an ultrasound of her heart two years ago. I am still concerned because she has never had this before so how could it be normal or at least NOT be a sign of something serious? I have an appointment with the pediatric heart cardiologist but they can't take her for another two months. Has anybody ever heard of this? If you have, please share what you know. According to the general practitioner, the normal person's heart sounds like lub-dub, lub-dub. But, my daughter's heart sounds like luba-dub, luba-dub.

I've been dealing with depression since I was a young teenager and I'm 34 now. I never really wanted to be on medication so I just dealt with it myself, for most of my life. I consider myself to be high functioning and I usually keep it to myself, until certain stressful events like my father's death and job difficulties made it more worse. I started on Prozac over almost 2 years ago, but got off of it quickly, switched to Zoloft, which I stayed on for a year. I wasn't crazy about it so started to ween myself off of it, and then I started feeling anxiety, which I never really had a major problem with. So my physician recommended Lexapro, which I've been on for almost 2 weeks. I'm not quite sure how I like it yet, becuase it's still early, although the anxiety has pretty much gone away, and the depression has somewhat diminished, although not totally. My question is, does Lexapro cause issues with weight gain, because I have been exercising like crazy every night for the past two weeks, and decreased my eating, but my weight has stayed the same, so I was wondering if it's the medication. Also, if it is the medication, is it a temporary side-effect, and will I return to normal eventually, cause weight gain is just one more thing to be depressed about.

I have been having SVTs off and on for about 18 years. For many years I was on Verapamil until about 5 years ago, I started having many SVT episodes. After many ER visits, echo, nuclear stress test and they found nothing wrong. I was put on Diltiazem 300mg a day and still had SVTs about one every other month. About 2 years ago, I changed employers and health insurance. Had to use mail order for maintenance drugs and was switched to Cartia XT. Have been on it for almost 2 years and not a single SVT episode until recently. Well, now they cover maintenance drugs at a local pharmacy chain and this past month they switched me to Diltiazem CD 300mg a day.

She didn't realize it was going to be that BIG of a deal and finally told them that she just thought she would get to move back and live with her dad. She wanted to go back and stay with her drug addicted father, who has nothing! He just goes from job to job to support his habit, doesn't have a drivers licence, and has no car b/c his mother buys him cars and he sells them for drugs. It is sad but true that he lives this way. I really feel sorry for him but even drug addicts should want better for their children, I mean he shold want her to be in a safe enviroment. He lives with his mother and she finances his wishes. She is selfish and treats my daughter as his pet. She is really the most EVIL and SELFISH person I have ever met in my life. I feel HATE for her and sorry for my ex-husband. My ex-husband has an excuse for making bad judgement, she does not! My ex loves my daughter dearly, she only screams and curses at my daughter, belittles and talks down to her. She only tolorates her b/c she wants to make her son happy. Anyway, about two weeks ago I started getting calls from my daughters teachers that she was no longer doing her work and they were concerned with what was going on with her. I was working with them and we had worked out a schedule for her to go to tutoring and I even got her a private tutor to help with her math. Needless to say though b/c this entire two week period she has been plotting with her father for him to come over here and pick her up. Now I have a summons to drive 600 miles to attend a court. He is actually sueing me for child support, for money to pay his attorney which is about 3000 plus a list of questions that wants to know everything except the color of my underwear. I feel the most betrayed as I think a person could feel by their child. She is 13 and making a horrible mistake in judgement. I could fight them and win with a lot of humiliation and knowing it will be just a few weeks or months before she is pulling something else. She has become a danger to me. I have ran out of ideas of how to deal with her. I know that she just wants to be where she has no rules, no expectations and can do as she pleases. I am afraid for her and I may be wrong for thinking this but I honestly don't really want her back in my house. I wish there was a way I could have her placed in a home for girls that are not to far gone but are heading down the wrong paths. Maybe give her the time to develope a conscience and some guidence in right and wrong. Have any of you had experiences simular to this? What did you, and how did it work out in the end? I know I am not the only person who has problems with their children, I need to hear from mothers of grown or older children to know what worked and didn't work.

Everything has been coming up fine, no findings. I am still bothered (emotionally) by these pains with no answer, so I went today and saw my gyno, who did an exam on the left breast and ultrasounded it - came up with nothing (fortunately!) - she said there is a fairly new diagnostic test called Breast Specific Gamma Imaging, which can screen for anything that possibly hasn't been seen on a mammogram. This test is done for women at high risk and also for women with dense breasts. I have been told where I go for mammos that I have dense breasts. I got very lucky and got in tomorrow morning to have this diagnostic test done, and I'm trying to not panic, but I can't help it!

447472489,"Combination (&gt;2 of manage, cause, or adverse findings).",No,,771588,I also hate myself...," I�ll try to keep this short and to-the-point. (I may fail at that though). Diagnosis: I have not been diagnosed with depression, although I have been prescribed depression medication when I was diagnosed with herpes two years ago. (I stopped taking the depression medicine cold turkey as I felt as though I was overreacting and that I simply needed to accept this diagnosis). Family life: My parents have been divorced since I was a baby, and I have no relations with my father. I have no relations with my step-siblings either. For the most part, my mom is a depressed person. She is very cynical, doesn�t have friends, hates her job, and would probably be diagnosed with depression if she saw a doctor. My sister that I live with was born with a brain injury. Her academic abilities are extremely limited, and basic tasks for her are difficult. Recently she had a schizophrenic episode which my mom and I have never seen before. After being in a psych-ward for a week, she was released and put on meds as well as seeing psychiatrists and doctors regularly. This will be a life-long regimen I presume. She is doing well now, but her overall well-being is heartbreaking. My family life isn�t the best. School life: I recently graduated magna cum laude from my community college with my associate�s degree. I then transferred to a university 45 minutes from home where I declared my major in engineering. I am currently taking the prerequisites for engineering, and have been having some difficulty. I wonder if this difficulty is stemming from my emotional well-being. I have been asked why I chose this degree, and I say that I am interested in math and science. This is true, but another reason I chose this is because I know that since I am the only other child of my mom, that I will ultimately be taking care of my sister and mother down the road. I feel a huge amount of pressure to make a lot of money in my career, as I understand my future responsibilities. I don�t even know if I want to do engineering. I�ve seen counselors at school to get academic advising, and they�ve all concluded the same thing: this is fit for you, you just need to get through the classes. Is depression prohibiting me from pursuing this? Or am I really not meant for this? I have had a lot of doubt about this, and have considered changing majors, again, a few times. Medical background: This is where it�s going to start becoming long. As stated earlier, I was diagnosed with herpes two years ago. That has taken its toll on me. I had a bladder infection two years ago that was pretty severe to the point where my urologist sent me to get my kidney�s checked to make sure they were not affected from the infection. By the grace of God, they weren�t. Life-long dialysis would have been the outcome if that had happened. I was given strong medicine to cure the infection, and after two cystoscopes, I was clear. Fast forward to now. I went to the doctor two weeks ago for bladder uncomfort. They took a pee sample and saw that another infection had started. I was put on an antibiotic for 5 days, and the infection was gone. Came back a week later because I still felt the frequent urination/urge to go issue. Another pee test was taken and everything in the test came out fine. I have now been referred to a urologist, once again, for possible diagnosis of IC (Interstitial cystitis). I won�t know this for sure until my appointment which is in a few weeks. Social background: I have friends, but I find that at no point in time am I ever on �good terms� with everyone. Now that I sit here and think about it, I always have an issue with someone. Today it is my friend and recently, my mom. I end up saying things to my friends that I later on wish I had never said. I end up losing friendships this way. I try to repair them (by e-mailing, trying to call) but some don�t respond. Some simply want nothing to do with me. I have been told straight up that I am not a good friend. I feel as though people like me if they don�t know me that well, but once they get to know me, they wish they never did. Romantic life: There really isn�t much of one. Obviously, I have an STD which makes things one hundred times harder. I have been dealing with an embarrassing bladder issue (to the point where I won�t go places because I know I will have �the urge� to go to the bathroom). This ends up making things awkward because I am constantly �bathroom-mapping�, and sometimes may do awkward things to hide this issue. I don�t want to tell someone, especially someone I�m interested in, that I have an issue like this. They�d run. I think about the guys I have dated, and each guy had something different wrong with why the relationship didn�t work. Friends always tell me �you can do better than him�. But when it happens times ten, it�s definitely me. I even got to the point where I got some guts and admitted to a guy that I was interested in a relationship. After texting him this, I literally got no response. What a kick in the heart that was. Some more stuff: I have a history of having nightmares; very vivid ones. Even if the dream doesn�t turn into a nightmare, my dreams for the most part are pretty vivid. I can remember them for days. Once a friend told me if your dreams are in color you�re schizophrenic, or something similar. God help me if that�s true. What I have done to help myself: I read self-help books. That is probably the only healthy thing I have done for myself. I try to remain positive, but with the load that�s on my mind, it�s very difficult. I had been on depression medicine before, but I hate to think that my happiness is forced. I hate to think that I can�t just be happy with what I have. I literally have concluded that I hate myself. And that is the reason I cannot get through my days. I have tried yoga, which has been nice, but I don�t think this will cure me. I have been going to the gym in hopes of losing weight. I�m not obese, but I could lose a few pounds. Losing weight is great, but will not cure me. One of the self-help books I read taught me that you cannot tell yourself that you will be happy �if I do (insert activity here)�. I know I need to find inner peace, and that�s what I have been trying to achieve. I will sum up how I feel:-I�m away from home in an unfamiliar place with no friends. (And the friends at home� there�s always an issue). -My medical background already wasn�t good, and it looks like it�s getting worse. Furthermore, I feel like I�m distracted because of my medical issues (constantly leaving class to use the bathroom. Wondering if people think I�m weird because I go literally everyday). - My relationship with my mom isn�t what I want it to be. She literally got to the point where she screamed at me last night (because of the bladder issue). I am already so down because of all of this, and the person I thought I could count on most once again, is not there for me. She has a habit of lashing out on me, and then apologizing later for her actions. Actions I�m thinking about taking: - Seeking medical help. Although I do not want to get put on more medications, I might have to. - Seeking counseling. - Starting to write a journal to keep track of my thoughts and how I feel. This could possibly help with my nightmares/vivid dreaming. I�m not sure what else I can do. I have literally one friend that knows everything about me that I just mentioned above. She has her own life to worry about, and I do not want to be the depressed friend constantly needing her shoulder to cry on. I need to stand on my own two feet. Anyone who really just read all of this, you�re awesome. And any response/feedback is appreciated. I don�t know where to turn. I�m sick of crying.",44,0.847418606

I thought it was side effect from the anti acid medication. When winter start all of the above stop!!!!! stop taking medication and felt fine. I started to notice that when I get the other symptom, I start to get more easily acid in my tummy, and even sometime the anti acid pill, don't really help.

I never really sought proper treatment because of my self defeating behavior. I have always thought that counseling would never work, and because I am such a procrastinator I would never even get as far as making an appointment. I went to one counselor set up for me by my dad several years ago, but after a couple sessions I felt that it wasn't doing any good so I stopped going. I also took Paxil for a month about a year ago, but I also stopped taking it because I didn't feel any difference. I am now at the point where this negative behavior is affecting my life far too much and although I have many good days, I have many miserable moments as well. I don't want to destroy and tear myself down anymore. I'm sick of seeing life pass me by rather than being involved in it. May I ask how you find the proper type of counselor/therapist for the kinds of issues that I described above?

I saw her for an intake appointment and right away she said, We need to get you on medication . I was put back, and a little nervous, but also a little curious to see if it would help me or not. I previously experimented with St. John's Wort and had no help from it. Maybe it was just too light for me-- since I've read cases where it has helped others.

I have 60 pills at the moment, and another 3 refills when I am through. I was also given two sample boxes of Lexapro (10mg). I've done so much reading on it. I have mixed feelings on it, because most that I read contained negative feedback. I'm worrying if it will be just like the St. Johns; ineffective.

Thus, the infection should be cured soon before it causes more problems. Some of the few basic home remedies for vaginal itching are: # Sanitizing clothes: The most basic reason of vaginal infection and itching is the dampness in the clothes which increases the fungal activity in the vagina. Thus, you should most primarily wash your clothes well and sanitize them thoroughly in antiseptics. # Select your clothes specifically: When selecting your clothes, make sure that you select the ones that are comfortable and not too tight. Also select cotton underpants over the other materials. # Buttermilk: Drink a glass full of lukewarm buttermilk every day before going to bed at night. This helps in curing the infection and also preventing its relapse. # Warm bath: Have bath in warm saline water. This will help you to destroy your bacterial infection and prevent the itching in the infected region. # Avoid sexual relation: During the infection, it is best to avoid any sexual relation as it can probably transfer the infection to the other partner and later might again affect you. # Tea tree oil: Tea tree oil is known to have anti-fungal properties. Thus, you can take about two to three drops of tea tree oil on a tampon and place it inside your vagina overnight. This will simply stop vaginal itching. # Yogurt: Even yogurt is another way to cure the infection. Thus, you can dip a tampon in yogurt and then place it in the vagina. Repeat the process for about 3-4 times and continue it until the infection is completely cured. # Apple cider vinegar: another home remedy for vaginal itching is the use of apple cider vinegar. Wash the affected region with apple cider vinegar properly to prevent the vaginal itching and thus cure the infection.",10,0.806595601

No family history of heart disease. Blood tests always show low chloresterol and normal blood pressure. I did drink a lot in highschool and through college, but these days I am only prone to binge drink once in a while. Well, one of those times was when I recently went to St. Thomas for a private charter cruise. The first night we go there we all drank heavily. The next morning (and for most of the cruise afterwards) I felt like death. Besides having the normal hangover effects, I was now noticing a bit of labored breathing and some tingling all up my neck, face, down my arms and legs, difficulty swallowing, and some weird aches between my shoulders. I felt dizzy and weak, and definitely stayed away from any on-shore excursions or other exertion. I mostly just tried to rest, but even that was hard because there's always noise on a sailboat and it keeps me up most of the night. When I got back home after a week my symptoms did not go away right away, which worried me. I thought all I needed was a few good nights of rest. I went to see my doc and he said I probably had heartburn or acid reflux, but that doesn't really explain the tingling or labored breathing (I wouldn't really call it shortness of breath ). And I've never had heartburn of ANY of these symptoms before in my life. So he sent me for a chest xray and to a cardio guy. The xray was fine, the stress test and echo cardiogram were all fine. I'm taking Prilosec but I have to take Gaviscon or Pepto a few times a day on top of that, plus I ocassionally still get some weird chest soreness on the left side, and at the same time feel a bit weak. Could I have had an angina attack (the first ever, I guess)? And could it be coming back or somehow associated with my acid reflux? I still have to go get some tests done but you know it always takes a couple weeks to get in a get tested, get results, etc., and I just wonder if I should be worried that I have a more severe problem. I told my cardio guy about the dizziness and weakness along with sweating (of course, that could have been the Caribbean sun) and he just said at my age and with my low cholesterol it was unlikely heart related.

I started having panic attacks about 3 years ago, and I was put on Metoprolol to help with rapid heartbeat from the anxiety. I was also diagnosed with high blood pressure, and so I was advised to continue the Metoprolol and start taking Lotrel. I was also started on Clonazepam for the anxiety. Lots of tests on my heart. Absolutely no problems, except occasional PAC�s (benign). My blood pressure has been well controlled. Recently, I got fed up with the side effects from the Metoprolol, especially the sleep issues. So my cardiologist put me on Bystolic 5 mg, instead of the Metoprolol. Bystolic is supposed to have fewer side effects, but for me it�s the same. So I called him back and told him I wanted to get off the beta blockers completely. He told me it would be OK to just stop taking the Bystolic. He said he had me on it more for the palpitations than for my blood pressure and that the Lotrel alone would control my blood pressure. I asked if I should transition off the Bystolic, and he said it wasn�t necessary. This seems strange to me, as everything I�ve read says don�t just stop taking beta blockers. Any advice? Has anyone just stopped taking beta blockers with good results? Any experience with transitioning off a beta blocker?",65,0.846115283

It progressively got bigger so he ofcourse went to the Dr. and they didn't seem too concerned. They put him on antibiotics for 10 days but the lump did not go away and still got bigger. They ordered an ultrasound and a mammogram. The ultrasound ofcourse showed a lump and they just received a letter about the mammogram saying there is a suspicious mass that needs to be analyzed ASAP. He has an appt. with his Dr. on tuesday and they are going to do a biopsy. We are ofcourse somewhat relieved that this was caught early and his Dr. has been on top of it without hesitation. My question is what are the chances of men having breast cancer and what are the survival rates with early detection? Do they vary between men and women? Also, this mass tends to swell and then go down to normal size. Is that a characteristic of a cancerous mass?

I'm 44 years of age and I have just visited my doctor about a lump that has appeared at the side of my nipple. It is a little sore to touch and you can feel it underneath the skin at the side of my nipple. My grandmother had breast cancer and so obviously I am imagining the worse. The doctor has referred me to a breast clinic. He said that he didn't think it was cancer and that it felt like just thickening of the skin but that he had to send me to be sure. I feel absolute terror. I have no one to talk to about this because I can't tell my mother because my father has been really ill and she has enough to worry about. My husband is working abroad and I just feel so alone. I'm waiting for my appointment to come through from the clinic but I go on holiday in nine days for two weeks (needless to say I'm not as excited about going now as I was!) and so I probably won't be able to go for an appointment for about a month. They did say they would try to fit me in before I go away but I don't hold out much hope. I just don't know how I'm going to get through waiting so long.

Although I was stoic throughout, the minute I was alone in recovery, I broke down in tears. I suppose this was from the emotional stress and invasiveness of something I'd never experienced. I was not overly concerned about the results, since my two sisters had gone through the same thing and ended up only with benign cysts. One sister even had multiple biopsies and then was advised to just stop there because they most likely would all be benign. Of course, the foreign language of the pathologist's report was confusing, but as my husband and I researched it, we didn't really find much to be concerned about. However, a breast specialist recommended a full, golf-ball sized biopsy (I don't think I even have that much tissue in there!)

Often times even as I talk to people and have a smile on my face I feel the darkness on the inside. Yet there are moments during the day when I can laugh and enjoy people and find some joy. I am so tired of this. I am sick of myself. Sometimes I think I must like feeling this way because I feel like this so often. Who was it that said we are as happy as we make up our minds to be or some crap like that? You know how that makes me feel -- it makes me feel like I choose to be this way.

I have no idea how other people feel most of the time -- if they feel lost, hopeless, despair, sadness, emptiness, suicidal, with some moments of joy thrown in. I guess at what normal is.

Atrial Fib. please help!," Hey, my names Pat and I went to the hospital a year ago with atrial fib. I don't take medication for a fib, but I do take medication for extra heart beats(Metoprolol). I was just prescribed this after having a stress test, 48 hr heart monitor, and a 24 hr urinary test done. My doctor seemed confident that this was all I had to worry about, but I am still having dizziness, especially upon lifting weights. Also, I still get headaches frequently(which I had hypothesized was due to my extremely fluctuating blood pressure). Furthermore, for the last 2 to 3 months or so, i've had constant congestion that I pull from my lungs. It's not a copious amount of congestion, but I still get congestion throughout the day. Also, I have had chest pain that has been on and off, but of late my chest pain feels more muscular rather than it dealing with my heart directly. I have had a slight amount of pain in my chest when swallowing. A couple things to take into account: -It is pollen season now. However I am not affected too much by the pollen itself. -I have a very busy school schedule which could account for the headaches(tension possibly);however, my headaches will, a lot of times, choose one side of my head to hurt. -I've read a good deal about different sicknesses/diseases of late, so the paranoia of cancers might drive me to exaggerate the symptoms that I feel if they're relating to a cancer of some sort.",65,0.812902131

I was told to follow up in six months with an MRI and then mammo four months later with an ultrasound. I never in my life expected to recieve a phone call from the radiologist tellling me the lesion looks like it has turned for the worst and is now suspisious for malignancy. I thought when they did the first biopsy core needle method that it would've taken out a good portion of it being it was so small. but I guess I was wrong. I have always known I was in the high risk category being both my sisters are breast cancer survivors. one had it at age 31 which was in her ducts, which wound her up with mastectomies. and the other sister had the other form but it was in a cyst that turned bad, which wound her up on tamoxifen for five years. it went away thank God. yesterdays biopsy was performed different than the 1st one. this one was guided by MRI and performed with a vacumme device. My birads went from a 3 last year to this year a 4B. I am not very knowledgable when it comes to the different types of cancers and diagnosis's but am learning fast. all I know is that my right breast is still swollen this morning even though I used the ice packs on it as suggested. I can't lift my arm up very far without being reminded I had surgery there. I never expected to be in so much pain and can't believe they say to take some tylenol for the pain? doesn't everyone have a different pain tolerance??? I never want to go through this again but know that some woman go through MULTIPLE biopsies... I know it's better to be safe than sorry and that suffering pain for a few days is nothing compared to what someone has to go through with chemo drugs and radiation compared to just a biopsy. but biopsies HURT! I feel horrible right now physically. I could't sleep last night and was awakened every few hours by the pain. NEXT time I'm asking for some pain medication besides just tylenol I wished I had known this before hand. the MRI biopsy was a lot faster and less painful than the needle core biopsy. because even though you don't feel pain every time she clicked the needle to get a sample of tissue, you still feel the pressure of it. the vacume method is a lot easier on the breast. it's the recovery period that is worst. any suggestions on how to feel better any quicker? they say not to excersice or do anything strenous for 48 hours afterwards. it would have to be 'superwoman who would not feel anything afterwards and get right back up like nothing happened.",23,0.292742064

After surgery I seemed to be healing fine until 2 months later when a little hole appeared at the end of the scar line. Was told it was the suture knot trying to come out and not worry just use antibiotic cream on it and keep it covered. This went on for a month or so then I was put on antibiotics (cipro) for a while and it seemed like it was closing up for a week then would reopen then close and open (the size of a pin hole) Dr. decides July 2010 that he needs to go back in clean out the tissue and the sutures and I would then go to the office twice a week to have it packed and they were not using any sutures to close it just in case it was my body rejecting the sutures. During the second surgery they also did cultures to make sure there was not a strange infection and it came back clear. Well finally about 3 weeks ago since the hole was pretty shallow he had me poke it with a qtip twice a day and finally was told as of last Friday to not poke it and let it close. Was also told I could finally shower (it had been almost 3 months). First day I am supposed to just let it close I took the bandage off and it was draining greyish fluid so I was told by the nurse to keep poking it til it stopped then let it close. So it finally stopped and I let it close. It was closed up and looked good from the outside (for about 3 days) until yesterday when I took a shower and found that same stupid pinhole back open and had nasty brown discharge. I am going to see the Dr tomorrow but I don't know what I should do! After a year one would think I would be healed. I am 30 years old, don't smoke, workout daily. I just am not sure where to turn to and if I should let the Dr keep treating me and if not where do I go? HELP! I am tired of this :dizzy:",23,0.462894558

Heart problems in early age have not been shown to run in my family. I have had on-going chronic chest pain since November and have a couple of questions for any readers here. When I initially began having chest pain in November the pain was widely varied (dull, sharp, squeezing, tightness, pressure, pulling, etc), and would radiate up into my throat and jaw, and would go down either arm and through to my back. It would occur in the center, the left side, and the right side. I haven't been able to pinpoint it to any certain thing (food, exercise, stressful situations, etc); it stays with me at rest and when I am active. I also had tingling in my fingers and toes and at one point my right arm went numb for about half an hour. After a couple weeks went by and this was still going on I decided to go see a cardiologist. Upon examination he believed it to be my chest wall and prescribed some medicine for me for 2 weeks (Meloxicam) as well as blood work, an EKG, a stress test, and an echocardiogram. I had the blood work and EKG done and they came back excellent. The medicine seemed to help a good deal; my chest wall was not nearly as sore and the radiating pain in my throat/jaw/arms stopped as well as the tingling and numbness. I took all of my medicine and while I was on it the chest pain practically vanished. Since getting off of it though, the pain returned. I did have the echo and stress test done in December, and they scheduled me to come back in March and go over the results with the cardiologist. Since then, I lost my job and had to move out of state to find work. I did ask them if they could mail the results to me, but they said they could not, so due to life being chaotic with moving I haven't been back to see them. Now that it is nearly June and the pain is still there, I have decided to go to a cardiologist here and have my results sent here. I know this is stupid for waiting so long on my part, but I figured that if it were serious they would not have made an appointment for March, over 3 months since I had the tests done, but would have called me immediately to let me know the results showed something serious. I am trying not to get nervous and paranoid about something being wrong. I am wondering, based on the situation presented above, does this seem like anxiety and not heart-related?",65,0.664679183

447489129,How should I manage or treat symptoms or conditions X?,No,,838262,Itchiness/Hives," Hi everyone! I have a question. Back in october I had an allergic reaction to Minocycline in which my entire body was covered in hives and I had to go to Urgent Care. They gave me three shots which made the hives and the itch go away as well as a three week tapered dose of Prednisone. During those 3 weeks I was fine, but once the prednisone was out I began to get itchy. Well... needless to say, here I am 4 months later, and still itchy! I have been taking antihistamines every day since i stopped prednisone to help with the itch but it doesn't make it go away. I'm literally itchy from head to toe every day, all day. My allergist and doctor both say it's hives, and that the only reason i don't have physical hives is because the antihistamines are supressing them. I am just wondering if this is the case for any of you? I was always under the impression that one would only be itchy where the hives are, but for me it's all over. Do any of you with hives itch all over? Thanks for your feedback!! Additionally, I was taking Doxepin for about 3 days but my itchiness was getting worse and worse. Is it common for that to happen before it starts to get better? I'm switching to Xyzal to see if that works for me, unless you guys recommend otherwise! So far i've done benadryl, claritin, allegra, hydroxyzine, prednisone, doxepin, zyrtec, and zantac. None have really helped me except the prednisone of course but i can't take that long term, and hydroxyzine is good for the 6-8 which i'm asleep at night. What recommendations, if any, do you guys have? is there any combination that works particularly well? I'd love to get some feedback from people who are going through this with me. Thanks guys!",10,0.435072929

My pdoc raised my Luvox to 300 mg's for about 2 weeks now. With Luvox it seems to work then fizzles out, then seems to work again, and fizzle out. Before trying a new AD my pdoc wants me to try going to 300 mg to really see if we should consider a change. He also augmented it with a very low dose of Abilify. I started taking Abilify at 1/2 pill of .5 mg for 1 week. Then increased to a whole pill. Worked great at first, but then started to make me feel like I have ants in my pants. Of course it could just be in my head. So now my pdoc told me to decrease the Abilify back to 1/2 pill and started me up on Klonopin - very low dose. I am very hesitant to take it because this class of drug is habit forming. The doc has reassured me over and over it is okay, especially considering the low dose I am on. I started taking it Saturday night. Does it take a while for it to kick in? My pdoc said to increase it to 1 whole pill after a week once we know how my body adjusts. I'm sticking with Luvox for at least another 5-6 weeks to see how it works at the 300 therapeutic dose, but I may have to change. Then of course I read all the side effects of Klonopin - and it makes me nervous, again my doctor tells me to stop reading them because they put every little ailment possible.

The did an abdominal ct and found nothing but calcifications but there was blood in my urine. I do have right breast tenderness but doc was not overly concerned (however being male he did not want to feel the one under breast nor did he suggest I have someone do so) I have never had a breast exam.

Although I hate that there are so many people in pain it's also a blessing to know I am not alone in the way that I feel. There is no one I feel comfortable speaking to about my pain . I have suffered many years with depression and thought I had seen my way out of it but seem to be sinking back into it. And medication is out of the question because of horrible insurance and lack of funds right now. Sometimes I can hardly breathe I am so down. I am a receptionist and there are times lately I can hardly talk on the phone. I live in a small community and they are very close minded about mental illness . I even tried speaking to my pastor about it. It's one of those things that make people very uncomfortable speaking about if they have never had to deal with it. My husband has had severe health problems and was forced into retirement that cut our funds in half. I work part time because I have three young children and need to spend time with them. I am getting ready to have to put my dog to sleep, we are behind on so many bills and I feel really overwhelmed with all of it. But it's not the reason for my depression. I've gone through this for many years but now the depression is making it unbearable. I can't sleep. I either over eat or don't eat at all. I don't want to be with anyone which makes it hard if you have a family. They don't understand. I would welcome sleep. I lie in bed and feel anxious. About everything and nothing. I know...makes me sound like a loon. And maybe I am. There are no professional counslers here in town. I'd have to travel and hour. So here the money thing comes up again. So for all of you out there that think they are alone...you are not. There are more of us out there than we realize. They don't have anyone either to talk to. I totally understand maybe feeling over dramatic or having people roll their eyes. That's why I don't talk about it with them any more. Which isn't healthy either I know but I refuse to have them judge me. Sorry I vented so much. Just feel pretty much alone right now. Just want to cry but no one will leave me alone long enough.

I am also a full-time student and work between 15-25 hours/week. I have a full load really. I've dealt with depression since I was 13 and have been on incredible amounts of medications of all sorts. In the last 4 years though I've been off medication and had felt like my life was better. Growing up my situation was bad enough I wasn't able to live at home, I grew up in hospitals, group homes and institutions. For me being able to be independent and feeling good and stable without medication was a huge step for me. I felt like I was finally in control. Imagine my surprise then when after the birth of my youngest child I developed postpartum depression. This was nearly 2 years ago. Since then it's been a constant swing of emotions and levels of functioning. I'm not able to properly take care of myself and I know it. I put my kids first and myself last because I have to. I'm not and have not been severely depressed. It's more like a mild to moderate persistent never ending low mood. I go through periods of time that last 2 weeks or so that are worse and then it levels back out. I'm underweight and cannot control this. I have tried but my appetite disappeared about 18 months ago. I've fought this but can't help it. My relationship with my husband has deteriorated because my sex drive is basically dead and has been for a long time. The reason I haven't seeked treatment or help is because I have a strong aversion now to mental health professionals. Growing up that was my life, it revolved around appointments and therapy and medication. Now I can't stand to think about seeing a therapist or psychiatrist. I did finally make an appointment with a clinic to see a psychiatrist but it's not until late October. I've left it there and haven't tried to get in earlier because I can't stand to think about it. I am a pharmacy technician (am a pre-pharmacy student also) and I work with medications all day and see people with different levels of functioning and it just brings back a lot of emotions for me and I can't tolerate the thought of taking anything, even Prozac. I'm just so frustrated because I want this to go away on it's own but logically I know it won't. I know I will have to go to this appt. when the time comes and comply with whatever is decided on but it's such a battle for me. My biggest issue is the feeling of a loss of control if I basically submit to these people. I don't want to see anymore mental health professionals and give control over to them. I have asthma and take several medications daily for that and manage just fine with taking those. I do take generic wellbutrin but not for the depression. I just started it about 2 weeks ago, it's to help me quit smoking. My asthma is not fully under control and the smoking is making things harder. Issue is I'm still smoking and I almost feel worse now emotionally than I did prior to the wellbutrin. I'm not sure how that's even possible. An antidepressant causing a worsening of symptoms? Just doesn't make sense. I felt horrible today at work. Very cranky, apathetic, anxious. I have developed this odd feeling of feeling like I'm just a small fish in a very big sea, if that makes any sense. Like I'm standing still and the whole world is spinning around. This all probably sounds horrible and makes no sense, I've just had a rough day probably. Any thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated. I just feel entirely lost right now. I'm losing my focus with life. I'm going to school to be a pharmacist, to have a good job I enjoy (which I do love my tech job) that pays well and is stable so I can provide for my family. I work as a tech so I can get the experience I need to get into pharmacy school. My husband works around my schedule so I can do what I need to do and fortunately we've been able to avoid having our kids in daycare. Sometimes though I get so exhausted mentally that I feel like if it weren't for my kids then I'd just give up on this, even knowing that I love my job and want so badly to be a pharmacist.

After that, a cold like conditions hit me, I thought it was the flu, as all these different strains are now floating around. Well, I never felt sick, just super congested. It's been over a week now and I'm still congested, still not feeling sick. My nose is congested, sometimes both holes so it's hard to breathe and I get occasional watery discharge from the nose, the infection like mucus is just not there. I don't have watery or itchy eyes, but I do get the itchin sensation in my nose and a scratchy throat from time to time. I've been using Afrin but it only opens me up for about a couple of hours.

I'm a 21yo female and I'm now experiencing an array of symptoms that none of my doctors can put their fingers on. I'm now wondering if it had something to do with my heart condition that I suffered from while in the womb. Before birth my heart rate was double that of a normal fetus, in the 300-s (I'm sorry I don't have exact details in front of me). I had a buildup of fluid in my abdomen because of it. My mom was flown to Yale where she was cared for by the prenatal cardiac specialists there. They diagnosed me with Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome at the time. They administered Digoxin to my mom, which slowed my heart eventually and I was delivered via c-section safely. I was monitored and kept on Digoxin for about 2 years. Now I get heart palitations very frequently (I recently wore a holter moniter that showed 150 skipped beats in 1 day), and for some reason have been undiagnosed with WPW (the cardiologist I saw for the holter said it showed no signs of WPW and that I probably never had that.) Now I am experiencing many things... what seems like a deterioration of my mental status (difficulty concentrating, anxiety, insomnia, staring, etc.), *severe* neck pain with no apparent cause (have had MRI and x-rays), blood tests of cortisol ACTH show that both are elevated, loss of apetite, weight loss, feeling faint lightheaded, cravings for sugar and salt, muscle pain/weakness, verrry sensitive to cold, and the list could go on and on. For almost my whole life I've experienced short moments of dizziness in my head where it feels like my body is rocking back and forth intensely. All of these symptoms have been progressing over several years...they're not just in my head. My dr says it could be something to do with the Pituitary. But does the pituitary affect your mental state? So my questions ARE.... What could have caused this seeminly random very fast heartbeat? What are the effects of having been on something like Digoxin while I was still developing? And could any of that POSSIBLY warrant looking into as a cause of what's now happening to me? I understand you all probably aren't doctors, but I'm just throwing this out there. ANY ADVICE, link to websites, etc. would be appreciated. Thanks.",65,0.60718855

I had the biopsy performed on the 3rd of this month. which it's now the 18th and my breast is STILL Hurting!!!

I feel this is ridiculous at this point and can't understand why this is not healing quick enough? is there something I can do or eat or take that would heal this sooner? the older I get, the less tolerance I have to pain. has anyone here had a vacuum biopsy method and going through what I'm going through weeks later??????

Man-made meaning is not good enough. I wish for more. Suffering is everywhere, most of it silent. People are scared of depression. I feel I cannot speak the depths of despair I feel, for fear of seeming too negative . If you say the world sucks, people will ask what are you doing about it, as if you are doing nothing. I feel terribly isolated and alone because I cannot talk about my despair. It WILL get a negative reaction. People do not like negative words. They like a smiley face. If your life isn't good, people assume you are blaming everyone else and doing nothing about it. Or worse, that you WANT to be depressed. There is a rare moment of relief when you find a compassionate soul who does not judge you. I was very saddened today by a story in the news about a guy who wants to be a baby. The story became public and he was raked over the coals - people despised him. Admittedly, a grown man wanting to be a baby is taboo - but the comments spoke volumes of the hatred people have towards those who are not 'normal'. It is very rare that people stand up for someone else. Compassion abounds in many instances in this world, but in many cases it is conspicuously absent. People do not have sympathy for what they do not understand, and they will not try to understand. Not to generalize - many people are kind and will attempt to understand an alien situation. I do not have a gift for words. This is coming out as a rambling incoherent babble. This is my depression. Despair over a universe that seems pitilessly indifferent. Does free will really exist? Choices exist, but they are limited by the faulty human brain. People tend to like people who are happy and not depressed. People who do not question much. Admittedly, positivity is an attraction. Real self is my despair - am a realist, scientifically minded yet to others probably an extreme pessimist. I just see everything as governed by chemical reactions and physics, no real justice in the cosmos. Freak events happen. Tragedies happen to the kindest people, and the opposite to others (or vice versa). No rhyme or reason. Is this overly negative, or is it realistic? Is it thinking too negatively to see limits in situations, to not be wishing for the stars? To see limits in human luck, the human mind and in love? To see that there are no guarantees, no promises, that all ends in gradual deterioration and then death? To be conscious of this every second, to the point where it strips the will to complete the simplest tasks? Why?",44,0.648311954

I�m just trying to figure out what is wrong with me and I�m definitely looking forward to hear what other people with (maybe) similar problems have to say. Couple of months ago I started having some episodes of tachycardia � out of the blue my heart would start racing so of course I went to the ER lots of times, have been diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and given bisoprolol 2.5 mg to take once a day. About a month after the onset of the tachycardia I started experiencing chest pain that radiated into my arms. (sometimes the tachy and chest pain would occur at the same times, sometimes separately, sometimes I�d experience arm pain as well, but there was/is no pattern to that). During one of the ER visits the dr said I have costochondritis and prescribed celebrex and Percocet for the pain. About 2 weeks after starting on celebrex and Percocet (I took celebrex 200 mg once a day and Percocet only as needed) I have started developing new symptoms: a feeling of buzzing in my whole body that comes and goes, diziness, a sort of lightheadedness, headaches that come and go, a combination of itching/tingling/pain in my arms, legs, hands and feet (mostly on the left side of the body), as well as in my face and scalp. Plus at times I feel my pulse in my whole body - particularly in the head. The itching/tingling/pains come and go at different times during the day, and they vary in length and intensity. Pretty much all of my symptoms have the tendency to come and go and they have the tendency to go away whenever I am in the hospital or in a doctor�s office� go figure� As the headaches got worse and I spent several sleepless nights because of them, I went back to see a doctor and I was told I might have a vascular headache/migraine, so I was given toradol by IV in the hospital and pills to take at home � the pills don�t always help, so I have yet another doctor�s appointment this week. Yesterday as I experienced both a headache (which seems to affect not only my head but also some muscles in my neck and shoulders) and some chest pain I took 2 toradol pills 6 hours apart (as prescribed). The pains subsided and I was able to rest over the night, but this morning I woke up with a large painful bruise on my right thigh (and yes I am 100% sure I have not bumped into anything, the bruise appeared out of the blue). Many of the doctors I have seen have told me that my symptoms don�t add up, and they are most likely stress related, so they suggested I have anxiety attacks � even prescribed ativan for me which sometimes seemed to help, still I am not convinced that all these problems are �in my head�, so I am desperately looking for some answers. Here is a list of all the tests I have had: blood work (at least 15 times) has always come back normal except for my blood iron which is low and a positive ANA titre 1:160 with a homogeneous pattern, chest X-rays (4-5 times) normal, 24 h Holter monitor � no symptoms, echocardiogram � normal, stress test � normal, 2 weeks loop monitor � awaiting the results, thyroid hormone (TSH) � normal, CT scan of the head � normal, MRI of the brain � awaiting the results. Needless to say that my stress levels are extremely elevated, not to mention that medical bills are piling up and all I have gotten from the doctors I have seen is that I have panic/anxiety attacks. Is it possible that the increasing amount of stress in my life is responsible for this mess I'm in? Are there any tests that I may need in order to get a proper diagnostic?

Anyway I don't normally do drugs, except have occasionally used Adderall to help me study for finals. I have used it 2 times before and was fine both times except for a panic attack after getting no sleep. So two nights ago I was using Adderall both days with a total of 50mgs to finish my 15 page essay up. Today I woke up really exhausted and throughout the day my heart felt almost sore but not painful or alarming. I am extremely paranoid normally and think that I have every disease in the book so it is normal for me to feel things that I don't actually have just cause of my paranoia, so I blew it off as nothing. However, later in the day I started to feel what I thought were papilations and I would constantly feel my heart to see if I had irregular heartbeat. My heartbeat did seem uneven, which again I am not sure if it was just the paranoia, and it really scared me. When I felt my pulse however it was perfectly normal, perfectly even, etc. There still fills like there is some pressure around my chest area but I generally feel better. Walking home was a lot more tiring today as well, but I am not sure whether it was because I was scared of getting a heart attack or the fact that I hardly got any sleep. So my parents are going out this weekend so I can't go to the doctors right now but I might ask the school nurse to see what she thinks. CAN ANYONE HELP ME!? I AM REALLY REALLY REALLY NERVOUS and I need to know if this is normal after 2 days of Adderall and will the feeling just go away with time or if it something serious and life threatening!

Around September or so (before my husband left for a hardship tour in Korea) my right breast nipple and breast started itching horribly bad and continued until around the end of October at that time I noticed a small hard tiny lump in my right breast below the areola area. It wasn't very noticeable, I had to press in pretty hard to feel it. I must admit I kinda forgot about it the last few months and just noticed that it has grown a bit larger (still small bigger than the end of a ball point pen but smaller than a pea) and can now be felt just by brushing the hand over the skin. I haven't had a lump feel like this before. Normally they are larger, unclear edges and rough feeling, easily movable and sometimes painful(my tell-tell signs of harmless cysts). This one is small, round, hard and I cannot get it to move. My period is due in the next couple of days so I plan to wait that out and then schedule an appointment.

447489190,"Combination (&gt;2 of manage, cause, or adverse findings).",No,,124974,Enzyme Potentiated Desensitization," I got an e-mail from my sister the other day about this treatment for all kinds of allergies. It sounds interesting but it is currently banned in the U.S. I thought it was worth researching and thought it may be helpfull to someone else. Here is what she sent me. A Treatment for Food and Other Allergies EPD is effective for inhalant allergies, food intolerances, and chemical sensitivities. Because all of the patient�s problems are being treated at once, a great improvement in general health should occur. Some of the conditions that have been sucessfully treated with EPD include hay fever, asthma, urticaria (hives), eczema, angioedema, anaphylaxis, food allergies, preservative allergies, chemical sensitivities, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism, Tourette�s syndrome, irritable bowel disorders, Crohn�s disease, ulcerative colitis, migraine and other headaches, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythmatosis. I looked up what it is and found it has an American version now but not real sure about it yet. It is a tratment that is injections that are given bi-monthly and could take several to really start working. Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme normally present in the body, so EPD does not introduce anything unnatural. However, because EPD �exploits� a natural phenomenon, it can be diverted by high-dose exposures to allergens at the time of the injection, medications, etc. Therefore, EPD patients must exercise strict control of their food and dietary exposures to allergens as well as avoiding many medications at the time of their treatments. For this reason, EPD has the reputation of being somewhat of an �ordeal� to go through. For severe food allergies, 6 to 8 doses or 1 to 2 years of treatment may be necessary before good results are achieved. However, the patient should notice some improvement within the first three doses. An American-made alternative to EPD now exists. This injection is called LDA (for Low Dose Allergens) and is based on the same principle as EPD, although it is in many ways different and improved. LDA is compounded in a licensed American pharmacy from American-made antigens manufactured in FDA licensed laboratories. The antigens used are the same as in conventional allergy desensitization shots, but in very low concentrations. In addition to common allergens, LDA contains uniquely American antigens which are not present in EPD such as cottonwood, sage, mountain juniper, some New World evergreens, American perfumes, new foods such as avocado, etc. I have been searching for something to help others in my family with severe allergies and looking for answers to the cause of the chronic hives I have had for almost a year now. Maybe this will help someone else out there too. So has anyone heard of this treatment or had it before. My problem is I have no idea if, or what I am allergic too. That would probably be the first step to getting allergy treatment. It may help someone with food allergies like my daughter that is allergic to nuts. Who knowsssssss :D",10,0.408663481

Some background: I'm 22 years old, maybe a little overweight, and trying to quit smoking -- on a typical day I used to smoke about 10 cigarettes, but have cut down quite a bit and now go some days without having any. I eat I guess...normally. Not particularly healthy, not particularly bad, just a good mix of lots of types of food. I go to the gym and do casually running as often as possible, which lately hasn't been enough. My job is VERY stressful and involves working long hours and constantly feeling frustrated/challenged. I def. do not get enough sleep. Anyway...lately I have been extremely nauseous every morning (I'm not pregnant). I never get sick to my stomach, but I just feel very bad. It usually wears off as the day goes on and my appetite hasn't really been hindered. The thing that really scares me is, every once in awhile, I get chest pains. Not excruciating, but enough pain that I notice it. It happens usually several times a day. The pain switches sides/locations, sometimes on my left and sometimes on my right...and sometimes it is above my breast closer to the center of my body, and sometimes it's underneath my breast closer to my ribs. The pains sometimes are quick -- 60 seconds. Sometimes they last for longer periods of time, 5-10 minutes. Also every once in awhile, my heart will stutter ...like skip a beat or so, and this causes me to have to take a deep breath. Otherwise, breathing seems fine. My heart rate seems fine for the most part too, except when I get these chest pains, then I can really feel my heart beating quite fast and hard. I have not felt weak or like I'm going to faint, just the chest pain. Do you think this is all just due to stress/anxiety? I know how stressed I am from work, but I have been stressed before and never experienced anything like this. I'm really scared something is seriously wrong...but am afraid to go to the doctor because what if I seem foolish if nothing is actually wrong?

After this visist I felt good again. Around 2 weeks again I had severe pressure in my upper back with some shallow breathing which worried me however had my oxygen blood pressure and pulse checked and this was ruled out as hay fever by my doctor again I had no discharge from my eyes or nose. A few days after this I came up with a really itchy skin rash and this was also blamed on hay fever the rash was a nettle rash or hives rash. After a few days of this I felt good again. Now recently last week I had a rather long heart pulpitation that worried me I've had them before and while during my tour of Afghanistan but they never really troubled me because they were pretty minor and before deploying to Afghanistan I was having them and I had a blood test and nothing seemed to be wrong. Since this rather long palpitation I've had a range of pains in my left part of the chest,left shoulder and left arm and hand mainly being sharp electric type shooting pains along with my neck and jaw, and more frequent palpitations which are really getting to me and I find then pretty worrying I've spoke with my parents about what I'm going through and others and everybody just says it could be anxiety stress symptoms.

I did go to the doctor's once 8 years ago, just to make sure everything was alright. Everything came out fine. And the pain went away until recently I feel it back a little bit. It might also be totally psychological too. Any input??? Thank you very much in advance!",65,0.003034247

I just got the results from her regular doctor a couple of days ago telling me her white count went down a few points (3.2). She has another doctors appointment with her cancer doctor (which will also want a blood count) and I want to find a way to bring up the white count in the next 2 1/2 weeks before she goes. I have been reading about foods and certain fruits and vegetables that can help to give her a better white count. I hear that zink is very good for this and there is a lot of natural zink in oysters, so I am going to give her a few of those also, along with Romane lettuce, spinach, multi fruits and lean meats. I also heard that there are drug they can give to bring up the white blood count called, filgrastim, pegfilgrastim and sargramostim. Now my question is: Are these drugs for Chemotherapy patients only? Can it be used on any one that has low white blood count? Also, does the fruits, vegatables, lean meats, oysters and all that that I am trying to do to bring up her white count really do any good, or is the doctor right when he said that there's nothing much you can do....I just don't believe that! I would be greatful for any responce of any type to my problem.",23,0.951006584

I am taking should have taken care of the wheezing.(ADvair) Well, this morning I woke with my heart pounding so fast I couldn't count the beats. Lately, I have been having palpitations where I feel dizzy and almost faint, but don't. What is this? do I have heart problems or is it just worse palpits. from before. A few years ago I had heart palpitations and wore heart monitor, but they said the heart palps./PVC were not life threatening. This terrible pounding and skipping beats this morning was painful and scary and different than any other palpitations I've ever experienced. I guess next time I should go to the ER.

I have had a mass on my right breast for a couple of years now. Last year I had my first mammo and ultrasound and they didn't find anything even though there is clearly something. I had a hell of a week worring about it. I called her after a few days and she told all was clear and to go again this year. Well, I had them done yesterday and her receptionist already called me back today telling me that she wants to follow up with me but the tests envelope says not urgent.

447472366,How should I manage or treat symptoms or conditions X?,No,,206715,Swelling hands= allergies?," I have a great deal many allergies, thanks to a skin sensitivity that I was born with. I've gotten used to it, having learned the fun way what things to avoid(i.e. everything), and for the most part I just live with the allergic reactions and don't really notice the near-constant hives. But here lately I've noticed if I go outside and get near the woods surrounding my home, my hands start burning and itching(the same feeling you get if they've gotten way too cold and they're starting to warm back up), and then they swell up like balloons. If I remain outside, my feet do the same. Yet there's no hives, itchy eyes, or runny nose... which usually tips me off to something I'm allergic to. I don't even have to touch anything to get the reaction. I'm going to assume it's a plant, but I'm unable to pinpoint which one. Over-the-counter medicines for allergies tend to ease the itching and most of the burning, but the swelling can last for hours and render my hands useless. So my question is this: assuming this is an allergy(I have no idea what else it could be), is there anything I could soak my hands in the relieve the swelling? Or maybe something that I could put on them? Thanks for taking the time to read this!",10,0.337405243

447472205,"Story telling, news, sharing or asking about experience, or soliciting support.",No,,731449,Estrogen-receptor breast cancer," One of the posts I read here was from a woman with estrogen-receptor breast cancer, and I also read here that a poster said breast cancer is an epidemic now. I wouldn't be surprised if our soy laced food supply is causing an increase in estrogen-receptor breast cancer, especially in post-menopausal women. Stay away from soy and all processed food containing any soy by-products. Some states like New York have mandated that restaurants not use trans-fats, so they are cooking with soy oil instead! Try to eat healthy prepared meals at home and buy organic product whenever you can. There have been studies linking grapefruit to breast cancer, so try to stay away from that too! Another thing, stay away from cosmetics, soaps, creams, etc. with lots of harmful chemicals in them. The only body cream I use is called 100% Pure made from fruit oils, and I use coconut cooking oil on my dry skin, and i buy a natural deodorant soap with baking soda, and I use pure organic Castile soap in my bath. I cringe when I see young girls and women in the stores buying creams and soaps made with harmful chemicals. Propylene glycol is harmful to put on the skin, it can cause kidney and liver abnormalities, yet it's contained in all boxed cake mixes like Duncan Hines, Pillsbury, etc. I was shocked to learn this and will never eat cake from a mix again unless it is an organic brand like Arrowhead Mills, but you still have to be careful and stay away from soy ingredients or eat them seldom, even in organic products.",23,0.66421211
